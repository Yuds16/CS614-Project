{"Question":"What does Haymitch mean when he says he is living in 'the old therebefore'?","Answer":"This phrase comes from a Covey song. For Haymitch, it refers to his state of living in the past, constantly haunted by memories of those he lost.

{"Question":"What is the name of the Head Gamemaker for the 50th Hunger Games?","Answer":"The Head Gamemaker is named Faustina Gripper."}
{"Question":"What is the 'Heavensbee spin'?","Answer":"The 'Heavensbee spin' is Plutarch's term for his method of media manipulation.

{"Question":"What is the name of the alliance of non-Career tributes?","Answer":"The alliance of non-Career tributes is called the Newcomers."}
{"Question":"Why does Haymitch initially believe his mentor will be a liability?","Answer":"The text doesn't explicitly state this; Haymitch has no preconceived notions about his mentors because District 12 has no living victors to serve in that role. He is surprised to learn he will have mentors at all, and his initial reactions are to Wiress's strangeness and Mags's immediate kindness."}
{"Question":"Describe the physical characteristics of the tribute train's main compartment.","Answer":"The train compartment is furnished with molded plastic seats in an array of neon colors lining the sides of the car. Haymitch notes that everything seems to be made of plastic, likely so it can be easily sanitized after they are gone."}
{"Question":"Describe the appearance of the arena after the volcano.","Answer":"The arena is coated in a layer of clear, sparkling ash that makes everything look as if it's covered in rock candy. While beautiful, the ash is a product of the toxic eruption."}

{"Question":"What physical feature is shared by Haymitch and Gale from 'The Hunger Games'?","Answer":"The teaser chapter for 'The Hunger Games' mentions that Gale and Katniss share the typical 'Seam' look of straight black hair, olive skin, and gray eyes. Since Haymitch is also from the Seam, it implies they share these same features."}
{"Question":"What is the name of the Head Peacekeeper in District 12 who likes a stiff drink?","Answer":"The novel does not give a specific name for the Head Peacekeeper in District 12, but Haymitch mentions that the current one likes a stiff drink, which is why he often turns a blind eye to Hattie's bootlegging operation."}
{"Question":"Analyze the arena's design as a tool of psychological warfare.","Answer":"The arena is designed to be a psychological trap. Its overwhelming, manufactured beauty—with cheerful flowers, colorful birds, and sweet scents—is meant to disarm and confuse the tributes. This idyllic setting makes the underlying dangers (poison, mutts) even more horrific when they are revealed. It's a landscape where nothing can be trusted, turning nature itself into an enemy and forcing the tributes into a state of constant paranoia. The design asserts the Gamemakers' total control, demonstrating their ability to create and corrupt even the most beautiful things for the purpose of a brutal spectacle."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch get through the holly hedge maze?","Answer":"He does not solve it. After becoming hopelessly lost, he is guided out by a gray rabbit that he had befriended earlier. He follows the rabbit's white tail through the twists and turns back to the forest."}
{"Question":"Why does Haymitch refuse to let Lenore Dove discuss the previous District 12 victor?","Answer":"The book does not state that Haymitch refuses; rather, it's Lenore Dove who never wants to discuss the previous victor when Haymitch brings her up, suggesting she knows a secret or painful story related to her."}
{"Question":"Who is the book dedicated to?","Answer":"The book is dedicated to Richard Register."}
{"Question":"What is the significance of Effie Trinket using her great-aunt's vintage clothing?","Answer":"The fact that Effie's great-aunt and uncle have a collection of war-era clothing highlights the long-standing wealth and stability of some Capitol families. It also provides a practical plot device, as the vintage 'threads' are what allow the District 12 tributes to look presentable at the interviews, ironically using relics of a past conflict to survive in the current one."}
{"Question":"What is the one thing Haymitch is certain of at the end of the novel?","Answer":"He is certain that the Capitol can never truly take Lenore Dove from him again, because his love and memory of her are his own. He concludes, 'Nothing you can take from me was ever worth keeping, and she is the most precious thing I’ve ever known.'"}
{"Question":"Summarize the different reactions of the tributes to the televised recap of the reaping.","Answer":"Haymitch is sickened by the flawless, manipulated version of events. Louella is confused, stating 'That's not what happened.' Wyatt, the oddsmaker, understands the strategy immediately, explaining that Plutarch 'stacked the deck in our favor.' Maysilee is cynical and scoffs at it, seeing it as propaganda to make the incompetent Capitol look good."}
{"Question":"How does Ampert get the sunflower explosives?","Answer":"He scavenges them from the bodies of the District 9 tributes who were killed during the bloodbath. He brings two of the sunflower tokens with him when he goes to find Haymitch."}

It features a golden spiral staircase leading to a balcony, a portrait of an ancestor above the fireplace, and a hidden bar concealed within a desk."}
{"Question":"What fashion advice does Maysilee give to the Capitol audience during her interview practice?","Answer":"She mockingly criticizes their taste, telling a woman with diamond-studded teeth that eating will be difficult when her gums recede and asking a woman with cat ears if her purse is for flea powder. She insults their 'garish color' and 'unflattering lines,' positioning herself as an arbiter of taste who is unimpressed by their wealth."}
{"Question":"What does Plutarch believe is Haymitch's greatest strength after he has lost everyone?","Answer":"Plutarch tells him, 'Then you have nothing to lose. That puts you in a position of power.' He believes Haymitch's complete despair and lack of personal attachments make him a powerful and dangerous asset for the rebellion, as he can no longer be threatened or controlled through his loved ones."}
{"Question":"Why does Hattie Meeney not distill liquor on reaping day?","Answer":"She avoids distilling on reaping day because she doesn't want the smoke from the still to attract attention from any Capitol hovercraft that might be patrolling the area."}
{"Question":"What is the name of the picture book by Suzanne Collins mentioned in the acknowledgements?","Answer":"The picture book is titled 'Year of the Jungle'."}
{"Question":"Analyze the difference between Haymitch's and Maysilee's forms of defiance on the train.","Answer":"Maysilee's defiance is overt and verbal; she directly confronts the attendant and later Drusilla to assert her dignity. Haymitch's defiance is more internal and symbolic; he silently rejects the birthday cake, refusing to participate in the Capitol's propaganda. Her method is about direct confrontation, while his is about passive resistance and non-compliance."}
{"Question":"What is the final memory Haymitch has of Lenore Dove?","Answer":"His final memory is of her dying in his arms in the Meadow after being poisoned by the gumdrops, asking him to promise that he won't let the sun rise on the reaping."}
{"Question":"What was Plutarch's stated reason for saving Lenore Dove from being shot by the Peacekeepers?","Answer":"Plutarch's stated reason was purely for the broadcast's entertainment value. He told Drusilla he wanted to 'keep her for the tearful good-bye,' stating that 'The audience eats that stuff up' and it would be a challenge to get them to notice District 12 otherwise."}
{"Question":"What is the name of the song from Edgar Allan Poe that is featured heavily in the book?","Answer":"The poem is 'The Raven'."}
{"Question":"How does Maysilee acquire her blowgun and poison?","Answer":"The text does not state where she got the blowgun, but she scavenges the poison herself. She mashes the poisonous blueberries from the arena into a paste and collects the toxic juice in a small vial she wears on a necklace, using it to coat her darts."}
{"Question":"What is Great-Uncle Silius's embroidered vest decorated with?","Answer":"The vest is embroidered with cocktail glasses, which Haymitch feels is perfect for his 'rascal' bootlegger persona."}
{"Question":"What is the terrain of the arena like?","Answer":"The arena is a deceptively beautiful natural environment. It features a vast, lush meadow with short grass near the Cornucopia that grows taller farther out. This meadow is bordered by a forest of green, gold, and orange trees filled with fruit and flowers, and in the distance is a snow-capped mountain. It also contains numerous streams."}

{"Question":"Analyze the role of food as a symbol in the novel.","Answer":"Food in 'Sunrise on the Reaping' is a powerful symbol of love, community, control, and deception. Simple foods like corn bread, gumdrops, and bean soup represent home, family, and comfort. The Capitol uses lavish food as a tool of control and propaganda, while simultaneously using poisoned food and water as a weapon in the arena. The struggle for safe, real food is a constant, grounding the narrative in the physical reality of survival and highlighting the stark inequalities between the districts and the decadent, deceptive Capitol."}
{"Question":"What is the name of Katniss's cat?","Answer":"The cat's name is Buttercup."}
{"Question":"How does Wyatt Callow die?","Answer":"He is killed by Panache from District 1 with a sword during the initial bloodbath at the Cornucopia, while he was trying to shield Lou Lou."}
{"Question":"Why does Maysilee mock the Capitol audience's fashion during her interview?","Answer":"She mocks their fashion as a strategy of defiance. By positioning herself as a superior arbiter of taste, she belittles them and rejects their values. It is her way of asserting her own identity and intelligence, refusing to be an impressed or intimidated 'district piglet' and instead turning the tables to judge her captors."}
{"Question":"Who are the Donner twins?","Answer":"The Donner twins are Maysilee and her identical sister, Merrilee. They are wealthy merchant girls from town."}

{"Question":"What does Plutarch's cousin do for a living?","Answer":"Plutarch mentions his cousin knows a Gamemakers' apprentice, but doesn't state the cousin's own profession. The apprentice is the source of his information about the arena's sun."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch get ahold of a second explosive in the arena?","Answer":"He does not get a second explosive. The sunflower token he takes from Ampert contains the explosive material. The fuse and blasting cap, he later discovers, are hidden inside the braided necklace token he took from Maysilee's body."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch learn about himself through his interactions with the geese in the epilogue?","Answer":"By raising the geese, he learns that he is still capable of love and forming bonds. He says, 'the walls of a person’s heart are not impregnable, not if they have ever known love.' The geese, who imprint on him like Lenore's did on her, allow him to reconnect with his capacity for care and affection after decades of self-imposed isolation."}
{"Question":"What is the final memory Haymitch has before he thinks he dies at the cliff?","Answer":"His last sensation is of the slippery coils of his intestines in one hand, the songbird on his flint striker pressing against his skin, and the earth quaking beneath him as the explosion rocks the world."}

{"Question":"What is the final fate of Beetee?","Answer":"According to Plutarch, Beetee is too valuable for the Capitol to kill despite his rebellious actions. However, he is being punished, and his wife is pregnant, which gives the Capitol leverage over him."}
{"Question":"What does Drusilla Sickle believe is the theme for her fashion in the 50th Games?","Answer":"She believes the theme for her fashion is the number 50, which she incorporates into her accessories. Last year, the theme was tiny buzz saw blades."}
{"Question":"Why does Maysilee tell Louella 'if you let them treat you like an animal, they will'?","Answer":"Maysilee says this to empower Louella after the sandwich incident on the train. It's her core philosophy of resistance: asserting one's own dignity and refusing to accept the dehumanizing treatment of the Capitol. By demanding basic courtesies like a plate and napkin, she is refusing to be seen as less than human."}
{"Question":"What are the flammable plants in the arena?","Answer":"The flammable plants are gas plants. They release a flammable vapor that can be ignited with a spark, creating a burst of flame."}
{"Question":"Why is the meal of bean and ham hock soup significant?","Answer":"Bean and ham hock soup is a traditional meal made in the Seam when someone dies. By arranging for the tributes to have it, Mags shows deep empathy and acknowledges their grief for Louella in a culturally specific way, offering comfort rather than Capitol luxury."}
{"Question":"Analyze the role of family as a motivation for the tributes.","Answer":"Family is the primary motivation for nearly all of the tributes' actions. Haymitch's desire to protect his mother, brother, and Lenore drives his choices. Wyatt's shame is tied to his family's disreputable business. Maysilee's actions are often in defiance of her mother's expectations. For Haymitch, the threat to his family becomes the ultimate tool the Capitol uses to control him, demonstrating that love and loyalty are both a source of strength and a critical vulnerability."}
{"Question":"What does Plutarch believe is the most effective way to gain public support?","Answer":"Plutarch believes that public opinion is driven by emotion, not logic. He advises the tributes to make the audience 'feel for you,' and the audience will then invent logical reasons to support them. The key is to elicit an emotional response."}
{"Question":"How does Wyatt Callow first reveal his expertise as an oddsmaker?","Answer":"After arriving at the Capitol, he sees the formidable District 1 tribute, Panache Barker. He then calmly provides a detailed analysis of Panache's odds of winning (five to two), his lineage, his weaknesses (a hothead), and his status as a crowd favorite, demonstrating a deep, calculated understanding of the Games."}
{"Question":"What is 'sleep syrup'?","Answer":"Sleep syrup is a powerful sedative, likely a medicinal concoction from the apothecary, used to render a person unconscious. Asterid March gives it to Haymitch after his family's death to calm him, and he later becomes dependent on it to escape his nightmares."}
{"Question":"What is the Covey saying that Maysilee's grandmother used to tell her?","Answer":"The saying is, 'It’s okay, Maysilee, nothing they can take from you was ever worth keeping.'"}
{"Question":"What threat does President Snow use to ensure Haymitch's compliance?","Answer":"Snow threatens to orchestrate the slow, agonizing deaths of Haymitch's family and Lenore Dove if he does not behave. He tells Haymitch he will decide how they die based on Haymitch's actions from that point forward."}
{"Question":"What is the final meal Haymitch and Maysilee share?","Answer":"Their final meal together consists of heated baked beans, crackers, and a trail mix of raisins, nuts, and candy, all scavenged from the packs of fallen tributes."}
{"Question":"What does the epigraph from George Orwell state about propaganda?","Answer":"The epigraph states, 'All propaganda is lies, even when one is telling the truth.'

{"Question":"What is the physical effect of the volcano's eruption on the arena?","Answer":"The volcano spews chemical lava that causes burns and a cloud of toxic, sparkling ash that coats the entire forest, making the air difficult to breathe. It transforms the landscape into a glittering but deadly environment."}
{"Question":"What is 'scrip' and why won't the Donner family accept it?","Answer":"Scrip is the form of payment the Capitol uses for miners, which is technically only supposed to be used in the official Capitol store. The Donners, being wealthier merchants, refuse to accept it, insisting on cash and highlighting the economic divide within the district."}
{"Question":"What are the three potential clues about the arena that the tributes discussed?","Answer":"Wyatt suggested the arena might be wet because of a training station focused on tarps. Maysilee thought their black outfits would be an advantage at night. Haymitch mentioned Beetee's potato battery, which led them to speculate it might be dark or they would have to dig for food."}
{"Question":"Analyze the role of music and poetry as a form of cultural memory and resistance in the novel.","Answer":"Music and poetry are portrayed as powerful vessels of cultural memory and resistance. The Covey's forbidden songs, like 'The Hanging Tree' and 'The Goose and the Common,' carry the true history of the districts' suffering and rebellion. Poe's poem 'The Raven' becomes a framework for Haymitch's own grief and trauma. These artistic forms stand in direct opposition to the Capitol's disposable, flashy media, representing a deeper, more enduring truth that cannot be easily erased and serves to unite people in shared experience and defiance."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch do with the coffins of his fellow tributes?","Answer":"He is forced to leave them on the train platform. After being abandoned there, he lays a hand on Louella's coffin before walking away into the deserted town, leaving them to be dealt with by the district authorities."}
{"Question":"What is the final fate of Beetee?","Answer":"According to Plutarch, Beetee is too valuable for the Capitol to kill despite his rebellious actions. However, he is being punished, and his wife is pregnant, which gives the Capitol leverage over him."}
{"Question":"What happens when Mr. Donner tries to bribe the officials?","Answer":"He runs onto the stage with a fistful of cash, trying to bail out his daughter Maysilee. A pair of Peacekeepers unceremoniously throws him off the stage, and he drops his money, which scatters on the ground with the confetti."}
{"Question":"What is the first sponsor gift Haymitch receives in the arena?","Answer":"His first gift is a bundle containing a dozen warm rolls, a block of orange cheese, and a bottle of grape juice with a long-stemmed goblet."}
{"Question":"What is the final memory Haymitch has before he thinks he dies at the cliff?","Answer":"His last sensation is of the slippery coils of his intestines in one hand, the songbird on his flint striker pressing against his skin, and the earth quaking beneath him as the explosion rocks the world."}
{"Question":"What is the first major clue Haymitch discovers about the arena's deceptive nature?","Answer":"The first major clue is the poisonous water. After he drinks from a beautiful, clear stream and becomes violently ill, he sees a rabbit die from drinking the same water. This makes him realize that the idyllic appearance of the arena is a facade and that all the natural resources are likely traps."}
{"Question":"What are the 'Booker Boys'?","Answer":"The Booker Boys are a group in District 12 who run illegal gambling operations, taking bets on events like dogfights and, most controversially, the Hunger Games tributes."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch find the correct mutt portal to enter for the sabotage mission?","Answer":"He follows Beetee's instructions to 'track returning mutts after an attack.'

{"Question":"Why was Mags a good choice as a mentor for the District 12 tributes?","Answer":"Mags was a good choice because of her immediate empathy and compassion. Unlike the chaotic Drusilla or the detached Wiress, Mags instantly offers comfort to Haymitch, acknowledging his grief for Louella. Her experience and nurturing presence provide a desperately needed anchor for the traumatized tributes."}
{"Question":"Who is the author of 'Sunrise on the Reaping'?","Answer":"The author is Suzanne Collins."}
{"Question":"What is the central message of 'The Goose and the Common'?","Answer":"The song is a protest against social inequality. It criticizes a system where the wealthy and powerful ('the greater villain') can 'steal the common from the goose' (take public resources for themselves) while the poor ('the man and flog the woman') are punished for taking a single goose to survive."}
{"Question":"How does the official recap portray Haymitch's relationship with the Newcomers?","Answer":"The recap completely erases his role as a founder and protector of the Newcomers. It shows him abandoning them at the bloodbath and makes no mention of his efforts to save Lou Lou or his alliance with Maysilee until the very end. His actions are edited to make him look entirely selfish and disconnected from any sense of loyalty."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch trade his first gift of white liquor for?","Answer":"He trades it at the apothecary shop for a fair price in cash, which he then uses to buy a bag of rainbow gumdrops for Lenore Dove."}
{"Question":"Describe Haymitch's act of defiance after Louella's death at the opening ceremony.","Answer":"Haymitch hijacks the District 1 chariot, places Louella's body in it, and drives it to the finish line in front of President Snow.

{"Question":"What is the significance of the geese Haymitch raises in the epilogue?","Answer":"The geese are a direct link to Lenore Dove, who raised them herself. By hatching a new flock that imprints on him, Haymitch is able to engage in an act of nurturing and love. They symbolize the continuation of life and his enduring love for Lenore, bringing him a measure of peace and companionship in his isolated life."}
{"Question":"Who kills the Gamemakers in the clearing?","Answer":"Maritte from District 4 kills one with her trident, and Maysilee kills another with a poison dart. The third panics and falls to her death down the mutt portal while trying to escape into Sub-A."}

They symbolize the continuation of life and his enduring love for Lenore, bringing him a measure of peace and companionship in his isolated life."}
{"Question":"What does the epigraph from William Blake suggest about the story's themes?","Answer":"The epigraph, 'A truth that's told with bad intent, \/ Beats all the lies you can invent,' suggests that the Capitol's version of the 'truth' about the districts and the Games, though presented with the malicious intent of control and oppression, is a more powerful and destructive force than any simple lie. It points to the theme of propaganda as a weapon."}
{"Question":"Describe the COURTESY OF THE CAPITOL stamp on Haymitch's shorts.","Answer":"The words 'COURTESY OF THE CAPITOL' are stamped across the seat of Haymitch's shorts. The shorts were made by his mother from a government-issued flour sack, and she wasted no part of the material."}
{"Question":"What is the 'continuum' that Plutarch refers to?","Answer":"The 'continuum' is Plutarch's idea that the rebellion against the Capitol is not a single event but a long, ongoing process that spans generations. He tells Haymitch that even if their efforts don't succeed in their lifetime, they are part of a larger historical movement ('we're all part of a continuum'), and their actions contribute to an eventual, future victory."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch find the 'sparking rock' for his flint striker?","Answer":"He remembers seeing shiny rocks at the bottom of the poisonous stream. He uses his spear to fish several out, cleans them, and then tests them one by one with his striker until he finds a piece of quartz that creates a good spark."}
{"Question":"Who are the last two Newcomers left alive besides Haymitch?","Answer":"After the porcupine mutt attack, the only other Newcomers left are Maysilee and Wellie from District 6."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch learn is the true reason for Beetee's presence at the training center?","Answer":"Haymitch learns that Beetee is being punished by the Capitol for attempting to sabotage their communication systems. Because Beetee is too valuable to kill, they reaped his son, Ampert, as retribution and are forcing Beetee to mentor him, making him witness his son's certain death as part of the punishment."}
{"Question":"What was Plutarch's stated reason for saving Lenore Dove from being shot by the Peacekeepers?","Answer":"Plutarch's stated reason was purely for the broadcast's entertainment value.

{"Question":"What happens when Haymitch smashes a chair into the window of the tribute apartment?","Answer":"His violent outburst is immediately met with the appearance of heavily armed Peacekeepers who restrain him with handcuffs. Effie Trinket and his prep team arrive to clean him up for his Victor's Ceremony."}
{"Question":"How does the official recap portray Haymitch's relationship with the Newcomers?","Answer":"The recap completely erases his role as a founder and protector of the Newcomers.

His actions are edited to make him look entirely selfish and disconnected from any sense of loyalty."}

Their horses leap the barricades and plow directly into the crowd, causing injuries to both Capitol citizens and their own tributes."}
{"Question":"How do Haymitch and Maysilee finally get through the holly hedge?","Answer":"They use a blowtorch scavenged from a Career's pack.

{"Question":"How does Plutarch Heavensbee convince Drusilla Sickle to let him manage the reaping broadcast crisis?","Answer":"He appeals to her ego and the demands of the show.

{"Question":"What is the significance of the train's furnishings being made of plastic?","Answer":"Haymitch surmises that the neon-colored plastic furnishings—cart, seats, utensils, cups, plates—are designed to be easily sprayed down and sanitized after the tributes are gone.

{"Question":"How does Haymitch get the nickname 'Hamwich'?","Answer":"His stylist, Magno Stift, is drunk and\/or high on toad venom at the victor's party and cannot remember his name correctly, insisting on calling him 'Hamwich'."}
{"Question":"Who is the book 'Sunrise on the Reaping' dedicated to?","Answer":"The book is dedicated to Richard Register."}
{"Question":"Why does Haymitch feel relief when Wyatt Callow's name is called?","Answer":"He hates himself for it, but he feels relief because it means his own name was not called. It is a moment of pure, selfish survival instinct in the face of the terror of the reaping."}

{"Question":"What happens when Haymitch and Ringina from District 7 first interact?","Answer":"They are at the knife-throwing station.

{"Question":"What promise does Haymitch make to Lenore Dove during their call?","Answer":"He makes her promise to stay alive and not get herself killed on purpose. He tells her that he will find her again in the next life, but only if she lives her current one out as best she can."}
{"Question":"Why does Maysilee tell Louella 'if you let them treat you like an animal, they will'?","Answer":"Maysilee says this to empower Louella after the sandwich incident on the train. It's her core philosophy of resistance: asserting one's own dignity and refusing to accept the dehumanizing treatment of the Capitol. By demanding basic courtesies like a plate and napkin, she is refusing to be seen as less than human."}
{"Question":"What does Plutarch's cousin do for a living?","Answer":"Plutarch mentions his cousin knows a Gamemakers' apprentice, but doesn't state the cousin's own profession. The apprentice is the source of his information about the arena's sun."}

{"Question":"How does Wyatt Callow first reveal his expertise as an oddsmaker?","Answer":"After arriving at the Capitol, he sees the formidable District 1 tribute, Panache Barker.

{"Question":"What are the three potential clues about the arena that the tributes discussed?","Answer":"Wyatt suggested the arena might be wet because of a training station focused on tarps.

{"Question":"Who is the protagonist of the teaser chapter?","Answer":"The protagonist is Katniss Everdeen."}
{"Question":"How does the novel explore the theme of memory and trauma?","Answer":"The novel portrays trauma as a cyclical, inescapable force. Haymitch is haunted by recurring nightmares of his losses, particularly feeding Lenore the poisoned gumdrop. His alcoholism is a direct attempt to erase these memories. The narrative structure, told as a recollection, and the frequent use of song and poetry as memory triggers, emphasize that the past is never truly gone and that the trauma of the Games shapes a victor's entire existence."}
{"Question":"What is the name of the Head Peacekeeper in District 12 who likes a stiff drink?","Answer":"The novel does not give a specific name for the Head Peacekeeper in District 12, but Haymitch mentions that the current one likes a stiff drink, which is why he often turns a blind eye to Hattie's bootlegging operation."}
{"Question":"Explain the irony of Maysilee's comment, 'I'll be your sister,' to Ampert.","Answer":"The irony is that Maysilee, who spent her life being defined as a twin and seemingly disliking it, finds a genuine, chosen siblinghood in the arena. She offers the role of 'sister' to Ampert out of kindness, only to later form the same deep, protective bond with Haymitch. Her journey is about discovering the true meaning of family, not as an accident of birth, but as a conscious choice of loyalty and love in the face of death."}
{"Question":"What is 'sleep syrup'?","Answer":"Sleep syrup is a powerful sedative, likely a medicinal concoction from the apothecary, used to render a person unconscious. Asterid March gives it to Haymitch after his family's death to calm him, and he later becomes dependent on it to escape his nightmares."}
{"Question":"What is the underlying strategy of the 'loose cannon' persona that the District 12 tributes adopt?","Answer":"The 'loose cannon' persona is a strategy of intimidation and unpredictability. By presenting themselves as wild and defiant, they hope to make other tributes wary of them. It's a psychological tactic to compensate for their lack of training and resources, making them seem more dangerous and less like easy targets."}
{"Question":"What is the name of the mayor of District 12 during the 50th Games?","Answer":"The mayor's name is Mayor Allister."}
{"Question":"What is the name of the other tribute from District 12 who was a merchant's child?","Answer":"Maysilee Donner, whose family owns the sweetshop, was a merchant's child."}
{"Question":"How do the tributes deduce that Lou Lou is from District 11?","Answer":"First, when offered a basket of bread, she instinctively chooses a crescent-shaped roll with seeds, which Mags identifies as a specialty from District 11. Later, she sings a District 11 harvest song that only someone from there would know."}
{"Question":"What is Haymitch's final act of rebellion in the arena?","Answer":"As he is dying from his wounds, he lights the fuse of his last explosive (the sunflower token) and throws it into the canyon.

{"Question":"How does Haymitch find the 'sparking rock' for his flint striker?","Answer":"He remembers seeing shiny rocks at the bottom of the poisonous stream.

{"Question":"What is 'card-stacking' according to Plutarch?","Answer":"'Card-stacking' is Plutarch's term for propaganda where you selectively present information, shuffling the shots and moments around to create a biased narrative that favors your agenda—in this case, making the tributes look appealing and the Capitol look competent."}
{"Question":"How does Lou Lou die?","Answer":"She dies after inhaling the pollen from a berm of poisonous bee balm flowers. She begins to bleed from her eyes, nose, and mouth and goes into convulsions. Haymitch rips the drug pump from her chest to end her suffering just as the cannon fires."}
{"Question":"What does the Covey saying 'Nothing you can take from me was ever worth keeping' mean?","Answer":"This saying expresses a philosophy of inner freedom. It means that material possessions, physical freedom, and even life itself are not what's truly valuable. What is 'worth keeping'—one's soul, integrity, love, and spirit—cannot be taken by an oppressor. It's a statement of defiance, claiming that the most important parts of a person are intangible and beyond the Capitol's reach."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch get the nickname 'sweetheart' from Katniss in the original series?","Answer":"The epilogue reveals that Haymitch started calling Katniss 'sweetheart' because as a young girl with her hair in two braids, she reminded him of Louella McCoy, whom he had called his sweetheart."}
{"Question":"Summarize the different reactions of the tributes to the televised recap of the reaping.","Answer":"Haymitch is sickened by the flawless, manipulated version of events. Louella is confused, stating 'That's not what happened.' Wyatt, the oddsmaker, understands the strategy immediately, explaining that Plutarch 'stacked the deck in our favor.' Maysilee is cynical and scoffs at it, seeing it as propaganda to make the incompetent Capitol look good."}
{"Question":"Analyze President Snow's leadership style as seen in his interaction with Haymitch in the library.","Answer":"President Snow's leadership style is based on absolute psychological control and the strategic application of terror. He doesn't just threaten Haymitch with death, but with the slow, agonizing deaths of his loved ones, which he would be forced to watch. He demonstrates his power not through overt rage but through calm, intimate cruelty, revealing personal knowledge of Haymitch's life to unnerve him and ensuring Haymitch knows that his compliance is the only thing protecting his family. He rules through targeted fear, not just brute force."}
{"Question":"What is the significance of the swan-shaped telephone in Plutarch's conservatory?","Answer":"The swan telephone is the crucial object that connects Haymitch to Lenore Dove for their final conversation. Its elegant and unusual form highlights the extreme luxury of the Capitol, but it becomes the vessel for a deeply emotional and tragic district moment, creating a stark contrast between the Capitol's opulence and the tributes' suffering."}
{"Question":"Describe the work Haymitch does for Hattie Meeney.","Answer":"Haymitch works as a 'mule' for Hattie Meeney's illegal white liquor still.

{"Question":"What is the 'Heavensbee spin'?","Answer":"The 'Heavensbee spin' is Plutarch's term for his method of media manipulation. It involves 'card-stacking'—selectively editing and arranging footage to create a specific, often misleading, narrative that benefits the Capitol and makes for better entertainment. He uses it to transform the chaotic District 12 reaping into a smooth, orderly event for the broadcast."}
{"Question":"Who are Haymitch's prep team members?","Answer":"Haymitch's prep team members are two University students named Proserpina and Vitus."}
{"Question":"What is the name of the victor from District 4 who serves as Haymitch's mentor?","Answer":"Her name is Mags."}
{"Question":"What is the one tribute death Haymitch does not witness in the memorial reel on the first night?","Answer":"Of the twenty tributes shown in the sky, he does not mention the death of the second District 5 tribute, only one boy and girl from District 5. The text says 18 died in the bloodbath, and later two from poison, for 20 total. It appears he miscounts or the text has a slight inconsistency, but he names 19 of the 20 deaths."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch do in the birdcage at the victor's party?","Answer":"He plays the part of a compliant victor to convince Snow of his submission. He banters with sponsors, poses for pictures, and allows partygoers to feed him tidbits by hand like a pet, enduring the humiliation in the desperate hope of protecting his loved ones."}
{"Question":"What is the brand of the tribute arena clothes say?","Answer":"The text doesn't specify a brand on the arena clothes, but Haymitch notes his flour-sack shorts are stamped 'COURTESY OF THE CAPITOL'. The actual arena outfits are just described as thin, black, silk-like material."}
{"Question":"What does the name of the District 1 tribute 'Panache' mean, and how is it ironic?","Answer":"'Panache' means a flamboyant confidence of style or manner. The irony is that while he has an arrogant and showy attitude, he is revealed to be brutish and unintelligent. His interview with Caesar Flickerman completely deflates his 'panache,' turning him into a laughingstock and proving he is all style and no substance."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch react when he first meets President Snow?","Answer":"He is initially rattled and intimidated by Snow's presence and reputation for cruelty. However, when he sees Snow is physically ill and vulnerable, his fear lessens, and he even commits a small act of defiance by drinking the milk meant for Snow."}

Asterid March gives it to Haymitch after his family's death to calm him, and he later becomes dependent on it to escape his nightmares."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch mean when he says he is living in 'the old therebefore'?","Answer":"This phrase comes from a Covey song. For Haymitch, it refers to his state of living in the past, constantly haunted by memories of those he lost. It signifies a life that is merely an epilogue, a waiting period before he can join his loved ones in the afterlife, or the 'sweet old hereafter' mentioned in the song."}
{"Question":"What does Plutarch Heavensbee do to ensure the reaping broadcast appears orderly?","Answer":"He uses the five-minute broadcast delay to his advantage.

{"Question":"What is the secret plan to sabotage the arena?","Answer":"The plan is to access the arena's underground utility level (Sub-A) via a mutt portal, locate the massive water tank, and detonate a smuggled explosive to rupture it. The resulting flood is intended to destroy the arena's central computer system, thereby 'breaking' the Games."}
{"Question":"What is the first thing Haymitch sees when he wakes up after the Games?","Answer":"He wakes up in a sterile Capitol laboratory with a greenish light. He is naked, cuffed to a metal table, and has tubes running into his arms and a large row of stitches across his gut."}
{"Question":"What is the significance of the song 'The Hanging Tree'?","Answer":"'The Hanging Tree' is a forbidden rebel song in District 12. It tells the story of a man who was hanged for murder and whose ghost calls for his love to join him. It's significant because it symbolizes rebellion, injustice, and the district's grim history. Haymitch's memory of the song connects to the themes of defiance and the secret histories that the Capitol tries to suppress."}
{"Question":"Why does Beetee believe District 9 is 'essential' to the alliance?","Answer":"Beetee tells Ampert that District 9 is essential because their tribute tokens, the sunflowers, have been replaced with cleverly disguised explosives. He needs Ampert to get close to them so he can scavenge the bombs after they are killed, as they are crucial to the plan to blow up the water tank."}
{"Question":"How does Plutarch Heavensbee convince Drusilla Sickle to let him manage the reaping broadcast crisis?","Answer":"He appeals to her ego and the demands of the show. He suggests opportunities to hit propaganda angles like 'No Peacekeeper, No Peace' and compliments her by calling her 'the professional,' effectively taking control by framing his interventions as helpful suggestions to make her look good."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch mark his path when he goes to find Ampert?","Answer":"He cuts small, discreet notches in the bases of trees with his knife to serve as markers for his return journey."}

{"Question":"What does Haymitch's mother do for a living?","Answer":"Haymitch's mother takes in laundry to support her family."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch's act of spitting at the Capitol crowd signify?","Answer":"Spitting at the crowd is an act of pure contempt and defiance. After the trauma of Louella's death and his forced performance, he refuses to play the part of a grateful or intimidated tribute. It's a raw, powerless gesture aimed at the people who view his suffering as entertainment, rejecting their system and their values completely."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch survive being poisoned?","Answer":"He survives by eating a handful of charcoal tablets that were in his backpack. He remembers his grandmother saying they were good for poison, and they act as an antidote, allowing him to vomit up the toxins."}

He feels he does okay on the scale but recognizes the physical threat posed by the more formidable tributes."}
{"Question":"Describe the physical environment of the 50th Hunger Games arena.","Answer":"The arena is a beautiful, idyllic, but completely artificial natural landscape.

{"Question":"How does Maysilee's confrontation with the Capitol attendant on the train characterize her?","Answer":"Her confrontation shows that despite being a wealthy 'town girl,' she possesses a defiant spirit and a strong sense of dignity. By demanding plates and napkins, she refuses to be treated as subhuman, establishing her as someone who will not passively accept the Capitol's dehumanizing treatment."}

{"Question":"What are the Chances known for in District 12?","Answer":"The Chance family is known for being wild, prone to drinking, and reeking of sedition. They have lost more family members to hanging than Haymitch can count."}

{"Question":"Why does Beetee believe District 9 is 'essential' to the alliance?","Answer":"Beetee tells Ampert that District 9 is essential because their tribute tokens, the sunflowers, have been replaced with cleverly disguised explosives.

{"Question":"Why does Haymitch initially have a low opinion of Maysilee Donner?","Answer":"Haymitch initially views Maysilee as a 'prissing' and 'stuck-up' town girl who has never faced real hardship. He resents her family's wealth and her entitled attitude, which contrasts sharply with the poverty and struggle of the people in the Seam, including his own family."}
{"Question":"Explain the concept of 'tesserae' in the context of the Hunger Games.","Answer":"A tessera is a year's meager supply of grain and oil for one person, provided by the Capitol. In exchange for each tessera taken for oneself or a family member, a child's name is entered an additional time into the reaping bowl for that year. These entries are cumulative, making the reaping system disproportionately dangerous for the poor."}
{"Question":"What is 'nepenthe' and what is its dual meaning in the book?","Answer":"Nepenthe is first introduced as a rosy-colored liquor in Plutarch's bar, which Haymitch recognizes from Poe's poem 'The Raven' as a mythical drug of forgetfulness. Later, Plutarch shows him a carnivorous pitcher plant, 'Nepenthes,' which drowns insects that fall into it.

His pack's contents are clues to the arena's nature."}
{"Question":"What is the physical state of Mags and Wiress when Haymitch sees them before the Victor's Ceremony?","Answer":"They have clearly been tortured. Mags is confined to a wheelchair, and Wiress is psychologically broken, twitching and muttering nonstop."}

{"Question":"How does Haymitch's view of 'hope' change throughout the novel?","Answer":"Haymitch begins with a cynical view of hope, seeing it as futile against the Capitol's power. In the arena, he briefly embraces a rebellious hope, only to have it crushed by failure and loss. After his victory, hope becomes terrifying, as any hope for a future with his loved ones is a death sentence for them. He tries to kill hope with alcohol, but it persists through his promise to Lenore, finally finding a grim purpose in the long-term rebellion and a quiet, personal peace in the epilogue."}
{"Question":"How does Maysilee acquire her blowgun and poison?","Answer":"The text does not state where she got the blowgun, but she scavenges the poison herself.

{"Question":"Analyze the arena's design as a tool of psychological warfare.","Answer":"The arena is designed to be a psychological trap. Its overwhelming, manufactured beauty—with cheerful flowers, colorful birds, and sweet scents—is meant to disarm and confuse the tributes. This idyllic setting makes the underlying dangers (poison, mutts) even more horrific when they are revealed.

The design asserts the Gamemakers' total control, demonstrating their ability to create and corrupt even the most beautiful things for the purpose of a brutal spectacle."}

{"Question":"Why does Haymitch refuse to let Lenore Dove discuss the previous District 12 victor?","Answer":"The book does not state that Haymitch refuses; rather, it's Lenore Dove who never wants to discuss the previous victor when Haymitch brings her up, suggesting she knows a secret or painful story related to her."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch get the nickname 'sweetheart' from Katniss in the original series?","Answer":"The epilogue reveals that Haymitch started calling Katniss 'sweetheart' because as a young girl with her hair in two braids, she reminded him of Louella McCoy, whom he had called his sweetheart."}

It points to the theme of propaganda as a weapon."}

{"Question":"What is the first major clue Haymitch discovers about the arena's deceptive nature?","Answer":"The first major clue is the poisonous water.

{"Question":"Compare Haymitch's relationship with his mother to his relationship with Hattie Meeney.","Answer":"His relationship with his mother is one of love and duty, though strained by her sorrows.

{"Question":"Analyze the role of food as a symbol in the novel.","Answer":"Food in 'Sunrise on the Reaping' is a powerful symbol of love, community, control, and deception.

{"Question":"How does Haymitch's perception of Plutarch Heavensbee evolve throughout the novel?","Answer":"Haymitch's perception of Plutarch shifts dramatically. Initially, he sees Plutarch as a manipulative Capitol media man using him for propaganda. After Plutarch arranges the call with Lenore and provides crucial intelligence, Haymitch is forced to consider him a potential, albeit untrustworthy, ally. By the epilogue, he understands Plutarch is a key figure in the rebellion, a 'good guy' operating from within the corrupt system, though Haymitch remains too jaded to fully trust or join him."}
{"Question":"Why does Haymitch refuse to let Lenore Dove discuss the previous District 12 victor?","Answer":"The book does not state that Haymitch refuses; rather, it's Lenore Dove who never wants to discuss the previous victor when Haymitch brings her up, suggesting she knows a secret or painful story related to her."}

{"Question":"Why does Drusilla refuse to allow the tributes good-byes with their families?","Answer":"She claims they have lost the privilege because of the 'outrageous display' during the reaping, referring to Woodbine's attempted escape and the subsequent riot.

{"Question":"Why does Haymitch realize he cannot trust any of the food or water found naturally in the arena?","Answer":"After being poisoned by the stream water, he connects this to the contents of his backpack.

His pack's contents are clues to the arena's nature."}
{"Question":"How does the Newcomer alliance grow from five districts to eight?","Answer":"The alliance grows in stages. First, Haymitch offers food to the traumatized tributes from District 6, who then join, bringing the total to six districts. Then, Ampert successfully recruits the tributes from District 11.
