    "Answer": "Haymitch's concept of 'winning' shifts from mere survival to acts of meaningful defiance. Initially, winning is just not being reaped. In the arena, it becomes about 'painting a poster'—making a statement against the Capitol. His ultimate 'victory' is not the crown, but his final act of destroying the force field, a symbolic blow against the system, even though he believes it will cost him his life. He redefines winning as retaining agency and purpose, not just staying alive.",

Haymitch lies to Lenore about her release to give her hope. The novel shows that in a world built on lies, deception becomes a necessary, albeit morally complex, weapon for all sides.",

    "Question": "How does Haymitch's perception of Plutarch Heavensbee evolve throughout the novel?",
    "Answer": "Haymitch's perception of Plutarch shifts dramatically. Initially, he sees Plutarch as a manipulative Capitol media man using him for propaganda. After Plutarch arranges the call with Lenore and provides crucial intelligence, Haymitch is forced to consider him a potential, albeit untrustworthy, ally. By the epilogue, he understands Plutarch is a key figure in the rebellion, a 'good guy' operating from within the corrupt system, though Haymitch remains too jaded to fully trust or join him.",

Mags is sending it to acknowledge their shared private joke and, by extension, her shared memory of Maysilee. It's a way of saying 'I remember her, I mourn her with you,' and perhaps a gentle reminder of Maysilee's defiant spirit, encouraging Haymitch to keep that same sass alive and not give up.",
