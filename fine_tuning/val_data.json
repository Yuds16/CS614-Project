{"Question":"What is the final promise Haymitch and Maysilee make to each other?","Answer":"They make a pinkie swear that if one of them wins, they will become the 'worst victor in history' by defying the Capitol and refusing to play their game.

{"Question":"Analyze the symbolism of Haymitch hijacking the District 1 chariot.","Answer":"Hijacking the pristine, golden chariot of the privileged District 1 tributes is a powerful symbolic act.

It represents the disenfranchised taking control of the symbols of power to challenge the established narrative."}

It recalls the moment in the tribute apartment when Maysilee sarcastically said, 'More ice cream?' in response to Effie's naive sister. Mags is sending it to acknowledge their shared private joke and, by extension, her shared memory of Maysilee. It's a way of saying 'I remember her, I mourn her with you,' and perhaps a gentle reminder of Maysilee's defiant spirit, encouraging Haymitch to keep that same sass alive and not give up."}
{"Question":"What is the name of Haymitch's younger brother?","Answer":"Haymitch's younger brother is named Sid."}
{"Question":"Explain the significance of the phrase 'Snow lands on top.'","Answer":"This is President Snow's family aphorism, which he tells Haymitch. It signifies his belief in his own inevitable victory and absolute control. It serves as a chilling declaration that no matter what chaos or rebellion ensues, he will always emerge in the dominant position, reinforcing his power and Haymitch's powerlessness."}
{"Question":"What is 'nepenthe' and what is its dual meaning in the book?","Answer":"Nepenthe is first introduced as a rosy-colored liquor in Plutarch's bar, which Haymitch recognizes from Poe's poem 'The Raven' as a mythical drug of forgetfulness. Later, Plutarch shows him a carnivorous pitcher plant, 'Nepenthes,' which drowns insects that fall into it.

{"Question":"What happens when Mr. Donner tries to bribe the officials?","Answer":"He runs onto the stage with a fistful of cash, trying to bail out his daughter Maysilee.

It features a vast, lush meadow with short grass near the Cornucopia that grows taller farther out. This meadow is bordered by a forest of green, gold, and orange trees filled with fruit and flowers, and in the distance is a snow-capped mountain. It also contains numerous streams."}
{"Question":"What happens during the first day in the arena in Chapter 15?","Answer":"The Games begin in a beautiful but deceptive meadow. Haymitch avoids the initial bloodbath at the Cornucopia, grabbing a pack and weapons and heading north as planned. He soon discovers that the water in the streams is poisonous after drinking from one and becoming violently ill. He survives by eating charcoal tablets from his pack. He realizes all the natural food and water in the arena is likely poisonous. Twenty tributes die on the first day, including District 12's Wyatt Callow."}
{"Question":"What is the significance of the gray rabbit in the arena?","Answer":"The dove-colored gray rabbit acts as a recurring symbol and guide for Haymitch. A rabbit's death warns him of the poison water. Another rabbit seems to lead him out of the hedge maze. It represents a small, persistent piece of the natural world and perhaps his connection to Lenore Dove, helping him navigate the treacherous, artificial environment."}
{"Question":"Why does Haymitch refuse to let Lenore Dove discuss the previous District 12 victor?","Answer":"The book does not state that Haymitch refuses; rather, it's Lenore Dove who never wants to discuss the previous victor when Haymitch brings her up, suggesting she knows a secret or painful story related to her."}
{"Question":"What happens when Mr. Donner tries to bribe the officials?","Answer":"He runs onto the stage with a fistful of cash, trying to bail out his daughter Maysilee.

{"Question":"How does Haymitch feel about Maysilee initially on the train in Chapter 3?","Answer":"Initially, Haymitch views Maysilee with disdain and fascination. He sees her as a prissy, spoiled 'town girl' and thinks about how different she and her twin are from the twin sisters his own mother lost. He has a generally negative opinion of her based on her behavior at school."}
{"Question":"Analyze the role of music and poetry as a form of cultural memory and resistance in the novel.","Answer":"Music and poetry are portrayed as powerful vessels of cultural memory and resistance. The Covey's forbidden songs, like 'The Hanging Tree' and 'The Goose and the Common,' carry the true history of the districts' suffering and rebellion. Poe's poem 'The Raven' becomes a framework for Haymitch's own grief and trauma. These artistic forms stand in direct opposition to the Capitol's disposable, flashy media, representing a deeper, more enduring truth that cannot be easily erased and serves to unite people in shared experience and defiance."}
{"Question":"What does Drusilla's threat to Maysilee, 'I will destroy you before you even make it to the arena,' reveal about the power of an escort?","Answer":"The threat reveals that an escort's power, while not official within the Gamemakers' structure, extends to wielding influence and inflicting harm on tributes outside the arena. It shows they can make a tribute's life miserable or potentially arrange 'accidents' before the Games even begin, highlighting the arbitrary and cruel nature of Capitol authority."}
{"Question":"Analyze the theme of deception as a tool for both oppression and survival.","Answer":"Deception is a primary tool of the Capitol, used to oppress the districts through propaganda and the creation of a beautiful but deadly arena. However, it is also a key tool for survival. The rebels use deception to smuggle explosives. Haymitch and Maysilee use a 'loose cannon' persona to deceive other tributes. Haymitch lies to Lenore about her release to give her hope. The novel shows that in a world built on lies, deception becomes a necessary, albeit morally complex, weapon for all sides."}
{"Question":"What promise does Haymitch make to Lenore Dove during their call?","Answer":"He makes her promise to stay alive and not get herself killed on purpose. He tells her that he will find her again in the next life, but only if she lives her current one out as best she can."}
{"Question":"What is the name of the final tribute to die in the 50th Hunger Games?","Answer":"The final tribute to die is Silka Sharp from District 1."}

{"Question":"What happens to Haymitch's prep team members, Proserpina and Vitus, after the Games?","Answer":"They are present at his Victor's Ceremony and the after-party, and also help prepare him for the Victory Tour. They seem to have passed their university assignment and are not punished for the events of the Games."}
{"Question":"How does Haymitch mark his path when he goes to find Ampert?","Answer":"He cuts small, discreet notches in the bases of trees with his knife to serve as markers for his return journey."}
{"Question":"What is the significance of the District 12 tributes being dressed in black?","Answer":"Initially, their black coal miner outfits symbolize their district's identity and their low status. Later, when Effie provides them with elegant black formalwear, the color transforms into a symbol of class and sophistication. In the arena, their plain black outfits, as Maysilee notes, could provide a camouflage advantage at night, turning a symbol of their impoverished origins into a practical tool for survival."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch do in the birdcage at the victor's party?","Answer":"He plays the part of a compliant victor to convince Snow of his submission. He banters with sponsors, poses for pictures, and allows partygoers to feed him tidbits by hand like a pet, enduring the humiliation in the desperate hope of protecting his loved ones."}
{"Question":"Why does Haymitch initially have a low opinion of Maysilee Donner?","Answer":"Haymitch initially views Maysilee as a 'prissing' and 'stuck-up' town girl who has never faced real hardship. He resents her family's wealth and her entitled attitude, which contrasts sharply with the poverty and struggle of the people in the Seam, including his own family."}
{"Question":"Why is the meal of bean and ham hock soup significant?","Answer":"Bean and ham hock soup is a traditional meal made in the Seam when someone dies. By arranging for the tributes to have it, Mags shows deep empathy and acknowledges their grief for Louella in a culturally specific way, offering comfort rather than Capitol luxury."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch trade his first gift of white liquor for?","Answer":"He trades it at the apothecary shop for a fair price in cash, which he then uses to buy a bag of rainbow gumdrops for Lenore Dove."}
{"Question":"What are the butterfly mutts and how does Haymitch defeat them?","Answer":"The butterfly mutts are beautiful blue insects with stingers that deliver a painful electric shock. Haymitch defeats them by luring them to a berm of flammable gas plants and then using his flint striker to create sparks, which ignites the gas and incinerates the swarm in a wall of fire."}
{"Question":"What is the name of Haymitch's younger brother?","Answer":"Haymitch's younger brother is named Sid."}

{"Question":"How does the official recap explain Wyatt Callow's death?","Answer":"The recap portrays Wyatt as a hero who died while protecting the bewildered Lou Lou during the initial bloodbath at the Cornucopia."}
{"Question":"What is the significance of the orange graffiti Haymitch sees?","Answer":"The graffiti 'NO CAPITOL, NO HANGING TREE!' makes him realize that Lenore Dove was part of the rebellion. Maysilee had hinted that she knew a secret about Lenore having orange paint on her nails. The graffiti is Lenore's 'ghost' reminding him of his promise to fight the Capitol, condemning him to live and continue the struggle."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch give to Wellie to defend herself?","Answer":"He gives her Maysilee's blowgun, which is loaded with a single poison dart."}
{"Question":"What is the underlying strategy of the 'loose cannon' persona that the District 12 tributes adopt?","Answer":"The 'loose cannon' persona is a strategy of intimidation and unpredictability. By presenting themselves as wild and defiant, they hope to make other tributes wary of them. It's a psychological tactic to compensate for their lack of training and resources, making them seem more dangerous and less like easy targets."}
{"Question":"What does Haymitch see in his new house in the Victor's Village?","Answer":"The text doesn't describe the interior in detail, but it's implied to be a large, luxurious Capitol-style house with modern amenities like reliable power and plumbing. For Haymitch, it is not a home but a 'strange Capitol cage' and a prison."}
