ry long time.  I never permitted any lovers to move in. I\nneeded to eat messily while reading, to sometimes not get dressed all day.\nTo work in bed. To wake up in the middle of the night with the edge of\nsomething brand -new and reel it in until dawn, then take a menth olated bathlike a champ after a big fight. Then sleep and sleep and sleep, unmolested.\nHarris texted. I kept my eyes on the road and he kept texting, the number\nkept going up. Three, four, five messages. It was almost like I had to get off\nin Duarte, for safety , if I didn’ t want to make the Oingo Boingo mistake.\nThe Hertz lot was just right there when I pulled off the freew ay so I\nidled in front of it. I don’t like aiding and abetting coincidence s so I didn’ t\neven glance around, but it would be funny if he knocked on my windshield\nwhen I was looking at my phone. The first text was the picture of Sam and\nme, taken less than an hour ago. And then a text that said, Could you send\nAstrid’s mom’s number. And then: Sam wants a playdate with her. And then: Just\nwhenever you stop next. I texted  Astrid’ s mom’ s numb er, turned the car off,\nand bega n walking around the block the wrong way. The wrong  way is the\nopposite of the way you instin ctually want to go. Maybe it sends a little\nkink down the wire and out into the universe—I’m here—or maybe it just\nmakes you more alert, so you notice more. Not that I would have missed\nhim, walking to his car . He saw me from a little way of f and nodded.\n“It’s going to take you a long time to get to New York,” he called out as\nhe neared, “if you stop at every little town.”\n“I had to . . . my husband was texting—”\nHe laughed, meaning there was no need to explain. He was taking his\nkeys out of his pocket.\n“Back to Monrovia?” I said.\n“Yep, done with my route. Home to the missus.”\n“Claire! Receptionist at Palaces!”\nHe grinned and shot me a finge r like a gun. It didn’ t really seem like I\nneeded to say goodbye all over again. I smiled brightly and went on my\nway.\nI drove unnecessarily fast, merging across all four lanes. I was driving in\nthe wron g direction, back toward L.A., but that didn’ t seem like too big a\ndeal. A lot of other cars were headed this way, it’s not like I was the only\none. I exited in Monrovia. I drove past Fontana’ s and parked in front of a\nsmoothie shop.\nWho really knows why anyone does anything?I walked  around. I browsed a pet supply store and an antique mall. I\ntouched a celluloid doll’s leg and a beautiful pink silk bedspread. I got a\nmanicure. I walked back to my car and then walked past it as if it were\nsomeone else’ s car and I lived here.\nWho made the stars? Why is there life on Earth?\nI sat in the library . I walked around the arboretum. I ate dinner at a\nrestaurant called Sesame Grill. The waiter said something about last year’s\nparade; he thought I was a local and I didn’ t correct him.\nWhen it started to get dark I drove the car a few blocks up to a motel I’d\nnoticed, the Excelsior .\nNobody knows what’ s going on. We are thrown across our lives by\nwinds that started blowing millions of years ago.\nA lit-up sign said No Vacancy , but the “no” had another “no” written\nabove it. No no vacancy . It was like any other junky motel except for two\nbig, dirty white columns that flanked the parking lot. The man at the front\ndesk said, Two nos make a yes, it was a temporary fix. He looked like an\nold surfe r. I was given a key to room 321, which wasn’ t on the third floor ,\nhe explained, there was only one level. I could pull my car right up to the\ndoor if I wanted.\nSam would have run around the room and instead of being disappointed\nby its drabness, would have ripped the plastic bag off the cup, unwrapped\nthe tiny soap, tried out the bed, turned on the TV, and stood in the closet. I\ndid each of these things myself , slowly . The room was surprisingly large,\nbut this did nothing for it—a more condensed space would have been\ncozier . The mattress was terribly thin. Once, on a work trip, I’d been put up\nat Le Bristol, in Paris. As I walked around the suite I began to weep. The\nwallpaper had pink roses and the carpet and curtains had pink roses and the\nbed was a beautiful bosom you’d never want to leave. Gilt mirrors, a small\nmarble-topped table, a pair of little Louis XIV chairs gathered  in a place\nwhere you migh t want to read a poem. The stationery , the robe, the lotion—\neach of these things was thicker and more exquisite than I’d previously\nbeen aware existed. I began to panic—how would I live after this, now\nknowing? And then I became angry . Not at the fundamental injustice ofluxuries built for an elite minor ity, no, just that I was only staying for two\nnights. In the end it was fine. I savored each meal, I took pictures like a\ndumb tourist, and when the time came to leave I mutely accepted my return\nto civilian life. I didn’ t get to keep the paintings I saw at the Louvre, either .\n—\nI called Harris. I told him I hadn’ t gotten as far as I’d hoped.\n“Where are you?”\nI squinted up at the plastic light fixture in the middle of the ceiling and\nwondered if all light, no matter  its form—candle, lamp, firefly—was from\nthe sun originally .\n“I’m near Zion National Park.”\n“Oh, well, you made it to Utah, that’ s impressive.”\nI was getting ready to say something about seeing the view through the\nwindows in the tunnel when I realized he wanted to get of f the phone.\n“I’m in the middle of something with Caro.”\nHarris never really wants to hear more than the minimum. Which is\nokay . There would be a time, after this time of formality , when we would\ngush to each other. And obviously right now I would only be adding more\n“lies.” Lies in quotes because people always use the word so righteously , as\nif the truth is a naturally occurring diamond. But fine, call it lying. Each\nperson does the amount of lying that is right for them. You have to know\nyourself and fulfill the amount of untruth that your constitution requires. I\nknew many women (like my own dear Jordi) who simply couldn’ t handle\nthe feeling lying gave them—it wasn’ t their bag.\n“What you see is what you get,” these women said about themselves.\nFor me lying created just the right amount of problems and what you saw\nwas just one of my four or five faces—each real, each with different needs.\nThe only dange rous lie was one that asked me to compress myself down\ninto a single convenient entity that one person could understand. I was a\nkaleidoscope, each glittering piece of glass changing as I turned.\n“Some people might say a kaleidoscope shouldn’ t get married , at least\nnot to someone so traditional,” Jordi had said when I told her this theory .“But I have a traditional side, too,” I said. “Must I be entirely that to\nmarry? Do we ask this of men? No, that would be humiliating for them\nsince they get their sense of self from their work and from the power and\nmajesty with which they walk through this world as a self-owning creature.\nSame.”\nOne day when we were both ready I would reveal my whol e self to\nHarris; this would be like presenting a sweater knitted in secrecy .\nOh. My . God , he would say . How did you find time to do this?!\nJust here and there, whenever I could. Sometimes even with you right\nthere beside me.\nI didn’ t even know you could knit!\nThere are a lot of things you don’t know about me; that’s the whole point\nof this sweater metaphor .\nOf cours e if you’re knitting for years the sweater eventually becomes so\nhuge that it simply can’ t be hidden.TCHAPTER 6\nhe next morning I lay motionles s on the scrawny bed for two hours. I\ntold myself this was okay since  it was easier to be present lying  there\nthan it would be back on the road; I was still working toward  my overall\ngoal. The sudden absence of responsibility was a floaty , frothy , almost\nhallucinogenic weightlessness. No one to make breakfast for, no need to\npack a five-part bento box lunch , no need to yell Put on your shoes! Brush\nyour teeth! (Kindly but firmly , again and again, not nagging but not\nindulging and always keeping in mind the future adult who was being\nshaped right now.) Why aren’ t your shoes on? Where are they? Here they\nare. That’ s the wrong foot.\nNo need to say any of these words and no one to drive to school.\nThere was a rap on the door and then it swung open with the shouted\nword Housekeeping!  I didn’ t move.\n“Checkout is eleven o’clock,” said Housekeeping.\nI looked at the clock. It was 1 1:16.\n“You’ll have to pay for another day if you aren’ t out in fifteen minutes.”\nShe had a faint accent or speech impediment. Her name tag said Helen.\n“I’ll pay for another day .”\n“Okay then.” She looked around  the room, not even discreetly . My stuff\nwas strewn everywhere.\n“Would you like your room cleaned?”\n“No, that’ s fine.”\n“Fresh towels?”\n“No, thank you.”—\nI got up and ate a PowerBar and walked back to the antique mall. I didn’ t\ngo straig ht to the pretty bedspread because I didn’ t want the woman who\nworked there to think I especially wanted it. It was densely filled and\nquilted in a star pattern, satiny but not garish, salmon colored. It was the\nsort of very feminine and decadent thing I’d wanted my whole life; I was so\ngood at knowin g what I wante d and then choosing something else at the\nvery last second.\n“How much is this?”\n“Two hundred.”\nI gasped.\n“It’s from the 1920s, in perfect condition.”\n“I’ll give you one-twenty for it.”\n“Oh, that’s not negotiable. It’s an immaculate piece. I actually shouldn’ t\neven be selling it; it’ s museum quality .”\nSometimes my hatred of older women almost knocked me over, it came\non so abruptly . These “free spirits” who thought they could just invent the\nvalue of things.\n“What museum?” I said.\n“Excuse me?”\n“What museum? A bedspread museum?”\nShe looked at me with surprise and turned away sharply . And now I felt\nthe oppo site of hatred. Who better to decide the worth of things? She was\nmaybe fifteen years older than me. Been there, done that, nobody’ s fool.\nShe wasn’ t even ugly, just not young, a little chubby . Until recently she had\nbeen a better -looking woman than me and she knew this at a glance.\n“I’ll take it. For two hundred.”\nShe silently took it off its wood en rack and began wrapping it in tissue\npaper . I put down my credit card and lowered my eyes.\n“One-twenty was a ridiculous counter ,” she said. “You should have\nstarted at one-sixty . I probably would’ve let you have it for one-seventy-\nfive.” She rang me up for two hundred and I made a mental note that sheowed me twenty-five dollars. Not that I was going to ask for it; I wouldn’ t\nunless I had lost everything and everyone and had nowhere else to turn.\nI took the bedsp read to a dry cleaner because who wants to drive across\nthe coun try with something musty smelling up the car. They said it could be\nready by three o’clock the next day . I checked the calendar on my phone; all\nI had tomorrow was “Denver to Kansas City.” I was given a claim stub. If\nanyone wondered what I was doing or who I was affiliated with I could\nbring out the stub: These people expect to see me at three o’clock, or shortly\nthereafter . Not an appointment exactly but certainly a commitment.\nEveryone thinks they’re so securely bound into their lives. Really I had\ndone almost nothing to end up here. I had walked the wrong way around the\nblock and then gone the wrong direction on the freeway .\nSince I was now definitely going to be staying another night I unpacked\nmy suitc ase and put all my clothes in the cheap chest of drawers that was\nreally just for show. I hung my New York outfits in the closet. Using my\ntravel steamer I steamed my skirts and blouses. Some of the outfits were\nandrogynous—a little menswear , a little street style. I left these things in my\nsuitcase in favor of my more overtly feminine and form-fitt ing clothes.\nHeels and pencil skirts, cropped sweaters, shirtwaist dresses with tight belts\naround the smallest part of my waist. Every old thing had a modern\ncounterbalance; past age forty you had to be careful with vintage. I didn’ t\nwant to be mistaken for an elderly woman wearing clothes from the 1960s\nof her youth. Young people especially had trouble making distinctions\nbetween ages over forty . When  I got my first Patti Smith tape, Horses , at\ntwenty-two, Smith was only forty-nine. But I didn’ t think of her as a\ncontemporary person; I wasn’ t even sure she was still alive because the\ncover of Horses  was a black-and-white photogra ph. Instead of know ing that\nthis was a stylistic choice, like vintage clothes, I unconsciously  associated\nthe record with the deep past of black-and-white movies. If anyone asked I\nwould have probably managed to assign the album to the right decade, but\nmost of life is a vapor of unconscious associations, never brought to light. A\ngood way to check your outfit is by running past the mirror , or better yet,\nmake a video of yourself runnin g past your phone. How old was that blur ofa woman? Was she from the past or was she modern? And where was she\ngoing in such a hurry?\nI walked around Monrovia in a red shirtwaist dress and white wedge\nheels. The commercial areas weren’t really built for walking, but there were\nsome nice residential neighborh oods. Several times I passed teenage girls\nwearing backpacks, their breas ts inflated by the hormones in cow’ s milk\nand barely cove red by tank tops. Whenever I saw them coming  I pretended\nI was from another country , projecting the air of someone so foreign she\ncould not understand or be hurt by anything American. I methodically\nwalked in every area, as if I was looking for something but with nothing\nparticular in mind. Near the freeway there were chain stores like Michaels\nand Bed Bath & Beyond and it was around here that I saw a Budget Rent-a-\nCar in the distance. I paused and swept my eyes across the street, already\nknowing what would be there:  Hertz. I stared at it with a funny feeling\nbefore turning and retracing my steps back to the Excelsior .\n—\nJordi thought that it was terrific that I was already of f-schedule.\n“That’ s the whole point! Just follow beauty!”\nI looked around the weirdly big, drab room.\n“I’m trying.”\nI bought some food at Grocery Outlet. I watched TV. I took a bath. In\nthe morn ing I did these same things again in the same order as if this had\nbeen my routine for years. It felt very natural. In the afternoon  I retrieved\nthe bedspread and carried it back to the motel, feeling a bit conspicuous\nwith such a big bundle. But who was going to see me? I smooth ed the pink\ncoverlet out on the double bed and stepped back, taking in the whole\npicture. The maroon carpet looked more intentional now, elevated by the\ncoverlet; too bad it was such poor quality . I could imagine a little vase of\nflowers on the desk. Above the bed there was a greenish-gray painting so\nblandly abstract it was of nothing at all. I lifted it off its clip and slid it\nunder the bed with the original bedspread.\nI felt very alive, kind of buzzy .I had never really decorated, not with actual money . Harris already\nowned our hous e before I met him so I just moved in, which  took all of\ntwenty minutes.  His dishes and furniture and bedding were of a higher\ncaliber than mine so I gave my few things to Goodwill, installed my books\nand cloth es, and hung my purple  toiletries bag from a hook in the bathroom.\nWhen friends came over I woul d immediately take them aside and explain\nthat almost nothing in this house was mine, this wasn’ t even my style. It\nwas actually more sophisticate d than my style; there was an enormous\nsquare, black wooden table with eight matching chairs around it. Where\nwould you even buy such a thing? In time I just let people believe it was all\nmine (“ours,” whatever). And some of it is: our spoons, for example. We\nkept losing spoons until finally there were only three in rotation. I can solve\nthis, I thought. I can single-handedly make this problem go away . And I did.\nTop-of-the-line spoons, too—ten of them. Sometimes when we are in the\nmiddle of an especially bad argument I think: I’ll just take my spoons and\nleave.\nWere the nylon motel curtains intentionally ecru or just dingy?  Even if\nyou replaced nothing else, new curtains (plus the bedspread) would\ncompletely refre sh the room; you didn’ t have to be an interior designer to\nsee that. Although, actually , I did know of an interior designer in Monrovia\n—or at least the receptionist of one. I looked up Palaces. It was a strip club,\nbut also there was a listing for Palaces by Stephanie Rosenbaum.  The\nwoman who answered the phone said Palacesbystephanierosenbaum with\nsuch force that it took me a moment to reor ganize.\n“Hi.”\n“You’d like to speak with Stephanie?”\nI sensed Stephanie was right there and that they were both in Stephanie’ s\nlive/work space.\n“No, no, not exactly , no. Is this Claire?”\n“Yes?”\nIt took a few tries to get her to understand that I wanted to work with\nher, not Stephanie Rosenbaum. Once she got it her voice dropped to awhisper and she said she would text me her number . A very discreet\nwoman. I called her after five and gave her the address of the motel.\nShe was tiny and pretty with long sandy-blond hair and delicat e, ringed\nfingers. Looking at her girlish hands I felt certain that she and Davey had\nlots of cuddling and special squeezes, maybe even a wrestling game they\ndid that always left her in a pile of giggles but then sometimes led to\nfucking. I’m so alert to intimacy; at a glance I can immediately tell what a\nperson’ s capaci ty for it is. Here in my room she was polished and\nprofessional, holding a notepad and pretending I wasn’ t her first real client.\nShe paced around, opened the closet, peeked in the bathroom . I told her\nabout Le Bristol in Paris. She looked it up on her phone and said, “Louis\nXIV, Provincial style,” as if this was a snap, a style she’d done a hundred\ntimes. She crouched down and tugged on the baseboard, experimentally\nprying it loose and then rejoining it with a pound of her little fist. I raised\nmy eyebrows; this was a tad invasive for my level of ownership.\n“So do all the rooms have the same floor plan?”\n“Oh, you’d just be decorating this one. This is the one I’m staying in.\nJust a few little improvements.”\nI watched her cock her head to the side and hold her breath. Was I\ncrazy? she was wondering. No. Crazy was spending thousands of dollars on\na hotel room and walking away empty-handed, a totally passive observer . If\nI canceled today I could still get my deposit back from the Carlyle, thank\nGod.\n“I really just want to replace a few things.”\n“And are you— Is that okay with . . . ?”\n“Do you not do rentals?” I asked.\n“Well, we—I—do, I do, but just to be clear , you’re—”\n“I rent by the day .”\n“And how long will you be here?”\n“I mean, whatever happens, I have to leave in two and a half weeks.”\nArkanda.\n“I see. Do you think it’ s . . . worth it? For that short a time?”\n“I do. Do you?”I watched her think about the nest egg.\n“Yes, of course. Have you ever worked with a decorator?”\n“No.” In fact I had harshly judged people who worked with decorators.\nBut I was following beauty now. “How much would it be, by the way, for\nthis room?”\n“Right . . .” She glanced around appraisingly .\nThere was only one correct number: I knew she needed twenty\nthousand, or her husband did, but would she have the guts to say it? She\nwas taking some arbitrary measurements using an app on her phone. She\nsquinted at the ceiling.\n“I’m gonna say . . . in the ballpark of . . . eighteen thousand. That might\nseem like a lot, but that includes all the materials and any furniture that\nneeds to be replaced.”\nAlmost. She was doing that thing that women do; begging for what you\nwant by not asking for it.\n“Of course I’d need it to be done in just two or three days,” I added. “So\nI’ll have time to enjoy it. Did you include a rush fee?”\n“I didn’ t. So let’ s just call it twenty .”\nGood girl.\n—\nSomewhat unex pectedly , she had great taste. On the first day she brought\nbooks of wallpa per with Post-its on all the rose patterns but also on rich\nbotanical prints with jewel-toned parrots in tropical trees right out of the\neighteenth century. She understood what was special about the pink\nbedspread against the maroon industrial carpet—in the afternoon she\ncovered it with an even richer maroon, a Grand Parterre Sarouk carpet made\nof New Zealand  wool. As she measured, cut, and then carefu lly nailed it\ndown with tiny, gemlike nails I wondered how many seconds until someone\nfrom the motel knocked on the door. Five? Seven? Eight seconds. I opened\nthe door on the first knock and before the old surfer could say anything\nClaire said, Hi Skip, and asked him to take off his shoes. He looked down atthe plush carpet and then slid off his flip-flops, looking uneasy . He padded\nslowly around the room. Claire paused her work, hammer in air .\n“Feels good, right?”\n“Feels expensive,” he said. “I’m not paying for this.”\n“She’ s paying.”\nHe couldn’ t stop kneading the carpet with his long toes. He cleared his\nthroat.\n“In any case, this violates the terms of your guest agreement. I mean,\nprobably . It’s probably destruction of property .”\nClaire made an of fended noise.\n“Can we decide that when I check out?” I said. “After you see the\noverall ef fect?”\n“There’ s more that you’re planning?”\n“It’s a whole vision,” said Claire, rising to her feet. “Some of our key\nwords are Brunelleschi, bur gundy , persimmon, dahlias, and tonka bean.”\nI wouldn’ t have said the key words.\n“Tonka bean. Now that’ s . . . what is that again?”\n“It smells like dark honey and cherries,” she said.\n“Oh.” He nodded slowly , squinting. “My mom had a porcelain ball—not\nreally a ball, more like an egg, with lots of little holes in it. It smelled like\nthat.”\n“A pomander ,” said Claire.\n“Maybe,” he murmured.\n“It’s Victorian.”\n“That sounds right.”\n“We’re gonna get back to work.”\n“I should get going, too,” he said, and drifted out the door. Claire shut it\nquietly behind him. Her power was impressive, probably Daddy’ s little girl.\nAt the end of the day she dragg ed the horrible mattress off the bed and\nwe carried it to her hatchback.\n“I’ll be right back with the replacement. It’s really nice— memory\nfoam.” She scanned my face to see if I knew what that was. For some\nreason she thought she was more worldly than me.“I know what memory foam is.”\n“Okay . So then you know it takes about a week to completely of f-gas.”\nI didn’t know this, not the exact time frame. I mentioned I was very\nsensitive to smells.\n“Of course,” she said. “The one I’m bringing now has already been off-\ngassed; in a week or so I’ll switch it out with your one. It’s breathing in my\nbackyard right now .”\nWhat a complicated mattress plan.\n“So the one you’re bringing . . . why can’ t I just keep that one?”\n“Well, you probably want the brand-new one since you paid for it.”\n“Right. Thank you.” It still seemed overly complex.\nShe toddled off with the old mattress and in less than twenty minutes\ncame back with the memory foam one. It was considerably heavier . We\ndragged it awkwardly onto the bed and remade it with the thick white sheets\nshe’d brought that morning.\n“Try it out. Y ou’ll love it.”\nI sat on it gingerly . It was very nice; I couldn’ t help smiling. She smiled\nback.\n“It’s my own mattress.”\nI stood up immediately .\n“Oh—I didn’ t think you would mind,” she said, “since the motel one\nwas filthy .”\nI stared at the bed.\n“Where will you and . . .” The name Davey seemed overly familiar , as if\nI really knew him. “. . . your husband sleep?”\n“Oh, we’re easy,” she said. “We have an air mattress—it’ll be fun! Like\ncamping.”\n—\nThat first day of the renovation  was day four of the trip: Kansas City to\nIndianapolis. As Harris noted, I had made up for lost time and was back on\nschedule. He asked me if my neck was aching and I said it wasn ’t. One fine\nday I would tell him all about me, and this trip would be one of my stories.We would be holding each other in bed, saying everything, laughing and\ncrying and being  amazed at all the things we didn’ t know about each other ,\nthe Great Reveal. Sometimes it would be painful, like if he told me about\nfingering his assistant, but none of it would be threatening because our\ncurrent level of intimacy would be so high that there was no room or desire\nfor anyo ne or anything else. We would just want to hold each other for the\nrest of our days (which might not be that many , depending on when this\nhappened). Even  though the amount of catharsis would be off the charts\nHarris still might get lost in the weeds so there should not be lots of little\ninventions for him to comb through; he shouldn’ t have to say, “But what\nabout the light on the wheat in Kansas? Y ou just made that up?”\nI didn’ t go on about wheat or my aching back or anything else. He said\nsomething gener al about work being hard. It was possible that he, too, was\nsparing me lots of made-up specifics to paw through later when he revealed\nwhat his “work” really was.\n“Sam wants to talk to you,” he said, and the child came crashing on the\nline. They wanted to know if I had a present for them already . Had I gotten\nthem something giant at the museum of big things?\nCaught off guard, I said I had. This was a mistake, obviously . (One that\nwould never quite go away .)\nCan I see it? they said, suddenly switching to FaceT ime with the\nhorrifying technological fluidity of a child. I quickly surveye d the motel\nparking lot where I was pacing. It could be anywhere.\nLook at you, I said. I miss your wonderful face. My eyes filled.\nIs it a big pencil?\nNo.\nCan I see it? Why is it so dark there?\nI’m outside.\nWhere’ s the pencil?\nIt’s not a pencil. Y ou’ll see it when I get home, it’ s a surprise.\nCome home right now! they squealed.\nI though t about it. For the recor d: on the evening of the fourth day—the\nfirst day of renovation—the pain was so sharp I briefly considered drivinghome and telling the whole thing like a funny story . If I had actually been\ndriving across the country the pain wouldn’ t be this bad; what made it\nexcruciating was how innocently Sam and Harris were going about their\nlives, unaware of my nearness. Why do such a thing? What kind of monster\nmakes a big show of going away and then hides out right nearby?\nBut this was no good, this line of thought. This was the thinking  that had\nkept every woman from her greatness. There did not have to be an answer\nto the question why; everything important started out mysterious and this\nmystery was like a great sea you had to be brave enough to cross. How\nmany times had I turned back at the first ripple of self-doubt? You had to\nwithstand a profound sense of wrongness if you ever wanted to get\nsomewhere new. So far each thing I had done in Monrovia was guided by a\nversion of me that had never been in charge before. A nitwit? A\nmadwoman? Probably . But my more seasoned parts just had to be patient,\nhold their tongues—their many and sharp tongues—and give this new girl a\nchance.\n—\nI told Jordi, of course.\n“So you’re staying there . . . for the whole time?”\n“Well, I’m taking it as it comes. But at a certain point there won’ t be\nenough time to make it to New Y ork and back.”\n“There’ s a fabricator in Monrov ia,” she said. “I used to go there all the\ntime when I was working in fiber glass.”\n“Then you know it’ s close.”\n“Real close.”\nI told her about redecorating the room, the wallpaper , the carpet.\nShe said I sounded excited.\n“Do I?” But now I could hear what she meant. My whole body felt like\nit was vibrating with nonspecifi c anticipation. I wanted to break out into a\nhigh-pitched keening noise.\n“But why there?” she said. “Why not a prettier place at least?”\nI said I didn’ t know . I had stopped for gas, and then lunch . . .“There was one funny thing, actually .”\nI told her about the boy I’d seen on all three stops. It was his wife who\nwas doing the room.\nJordi told me about a folktale where a troll appears three times. She’s\nalways bringing up things from mythology and history . If it was anyone else\nI would be so bored by this, but with her I kind of like it. In the folktale it’s\nultimately not the troll himself who is important, it’s the number three.\nMaybe this was like that?\nI said I thought maybe it was. We mused about if she should come visit\nme; she shouldn’ t because that would make her complicit in a lie. My\nfriend: she’s very good. Like a nun or a saint—not a prude, just kind of\nholy. Now she was telling me a dream she’d had about chiseling green\nmarble.\nThat night I lay in the pitch-blac k room on Claire and Davey’ s marriage\nbed, under the star coverlet. It felt like I was lying in the center of a ritual\noffering, an elaborate spell. In two more days the room would be ready .\nReady for what?  I tried to make the high-pitched keening noise, but each\ntime it came out too mournful, like a wail, the bleat of a lost goat.\n—\nClaire did this thing where she knocked as she was openin g the door with\nthe key I’d given her, so I was always scrambling to pull myself together ,\nwiping my face, tucking in my shirt, while she said Hi, hi, hiii! Today she\nhurried into the bathroom, where she placed a glass bottle of tonka bean\nbodywash and some lotion made by Italian nuns. She pulled the thin hotel\ntowels of f the rack and replaced them with new snowy white ones that came\nfrom a giant canvas tote.\n“Touch,” she said, pointing at the new towels. I politely patted one and\nthen rubbed it with both hands and pressed my face into it. It was the nicest\ntowel I’d ever felt. So thick and absorbent it made all previous towels seem\nlike sad little rags. There was a giant bath sheet, a hand towel, a washcloth,\nand another one that Claire described as a “demi-towel”—it was for\nanything truly dirty, like a toothpastey mouth or hair with conditioner in it.“The demi-towel preserves the other towels for your face and body ,” she\nsaid, placing it beside the sink.\n“Did you make up ‘demi-towel’?” I whispered.\n“You can just leave the towels wherever and Helen will replace them\nwith a clean set every day, just the same as usual.” I noticed Claire ignored\nabout half the things I said to her, which made me feel a little like I was\ntalking to my hard-of-hearing mother .\nWhile Claire and a plumber replaced the little bathtub with a different,\nbetter bathtub and “rainshower”  head I sat in my car, making calls. I told\nmy manager , Liza, to cancel the reservation at the Carlyle and my meeting\nwith the feminist shoe designer and to try to get a refund on the tickets for\nthe one-woman off-Broadway show, although, I emphasized, that was less\nimportant than canceling the hotel, which, alone, ate up more than half of\nthe whiskey money .\nLiza didn’ t ask why. She wasn’ t someone I ever had to explain myself to\nor be embarrassed in front of since she had no actual interest in my field;\nshe was just someone I’d gone to high school with. During a rough,\npostdivorce financial patch, she’d reached out to our entire class, and even\nthough I had never once talked to her in school I said she could assist me\nfor a few months until she got back on her feet. During those months I\nfinished the body of work that would make my name, and Liza, I guess,\nmanaged things . In any case it had gone well and now that she was\neveryone’ s point of contact it never felt right to ask if she could move on,\nespecially once  she was diagn osed with fibromyalgia. Harris loves to\nspeculate about how much money I could have made over the years if I had\na real manager instead of Liza.\nI can never quite  explain how the terms of my success are built upon an\nagreement to carry this person on my back for the rest of my life. There has\nto be a burden to keep everything in balance. (Needless to say, a man would\nnever get bogged down in this kind of weird financial penance.) Also\neveryone likes Liza. Everywhere I go, all over the world, people ask How’ s\nLiza?  and are slightly disappointed that I’m not as gregarious as she is.\nAfter events, if I’m made to go out, I usually wind up answ ering theirquestions about Liza and kind of elaborating on our relationship, making it\nsound like we were lovers in high school and now that I’m married, we\npersist, slightly tortured by our attraction, forever bound. This isn’t at all\ntrue. But there is often one masc-of-center woman or nonbi nary person\namong the faculty hosts and they blink as I tell this story , take a sip of their\nsober beverage, look at their shoes, and when they look up I meet their eyes\nwith a hot yes. I don’t take it further than this. I only need my lesbianism\nheld and kept, like a person who buries little bits of money all over the\nworld—it’ s never on me, but it’ s never far .\n“Where are you now?” Liza asked before we got of f.\n“Almost to Pittsbur gh.”\n“So, tomorrow New Y ork.”\n“Tomorrow New York,” I said, watching a fellow guest clean something\noff the back seat of her car with wet wipes. Probably child’ s vomit.\nI canceled all my friend dates with a text explaining that I’d had an\nartistic revelation and was going to use my time at the Carly le as a solo\nwriting retreat but I’d reach out next time I was in town. One friend wrote,\nGo get ’em tiger / can’t wait to see the world you are conjuring! I tried to let the self-\nloathing blow past me like a cloud. There was only one friend, a woman\nnamed Mary, who I was too close with to do this, so to her I just said I was\nhaving a bit of a crisis but I couldn’ t go into it now .\n“As in . . . midlife?”\nI laughe d, no. Although maybe midlife crises were just poorly marketed,\nmaybe each one was profound and unique and it was only a few silly men\nin red convertibles who gave them a bad name. I imagined greeting such a\nman solemnly: I see you have reached a time of great question ing. God be\nwith you, seeker .\n“Are you having an af fair?”\n“No, no, nothing like that.”\n“Menopause?”\nI laughed. Mary was older than me and obsessed with hot flashes. She\ntook the opportunity now to tell me a story about putting her head in the\nfreezer at a party , and I laughed again. I kind of liked not knowing anythingabout this stuff. My ignorance  made me feel like a sweet little sister ,\npractically a child.\n“But if it ever comes up, we had lunch, okay?”\n“We had lunch and it was delicious and I loved seeing you,” Mary said.\nThis made me whimper . Probably I should have just driven to New\nYork.\n“I love you.”\n“I love you, too. Good luck, sweetie.”\n—\nAfter lunch Claire breathlessl y wheeled in a heavy box on a little\ncollapsible luggage trolley .\n“This is the last of these. Completely discontinued, vinta ge from\nPortugal.” She threw her purse  down and began puzzling hexagonal tiles\ntogether on the bathroom floor . “First I went to International Stone and Tile\nand they were so overpriced that I thought what the hell, I might as well\ntake a look at Radwill’ s.”\nRadwill’ s. I passed that sign every day on my way to Sam’ s school. I\nwanted to believe that we were farther away than that, but of course we\nweren’ t. Should I drive past the school to maybe catch a glimps e of recess?\nNo, that would be creepy .\nI knelt beside Claire and started fitting the hexagons along the edge of\nthe bathtub.\n“Use these ones for that.” She pointed toward a stack of half hexagons.\nNot sawed in half, but ingeniously designed for edges. The tiles were pale\ngreen with gold stars formed by joining with two others. Each hexagon had\nthe possibility of creating three stars if it could be completely encircled by\nsix more , a mathematically expanding galaxy . We moved quickly across the\nfloor , our patterns occasionally  joining in the manner of people silently\ncollaborating on a giant jigsaw puzzle. We wanted to know if there would\nbe enough to cover the whole floor and as the stacks dwindle d it seemed\nless and less likely  . . . there was a hurry to the finish, both of us sweaty\nnow. I handed her the final tiles. She pressed them into place.“Almost. Just three or four short ,” she said, sitting back on her heels and\nblowing air under her bangs. “I can get a few solid green ones; I’ll hide\nthem behind the toilet.”\nI stood and took in the whole floor , hypnotized by the repeating design.\nIt was giving me a peculiar feeling.\n“If we’d had the exact amount,” I said, “like if the pattern had been\ncomplete, doesn’ t it feel like something might have . . . happened ?”\n“I’ll prepare the floor and cement them down,” she said. “You’ll have to\nbe a little careful for forty-eight hours.”\nI was thinking of illusions that become so complete they actually opened\nup into other dimensions. I tried to think if this ever really happ ened or if it\nwas just something I’d wanted for so long that it felt familiar . A mean little\ntap on the door startled us. I hurried across the room and peeked out.\n“I’m good for towels, thanks.”\n“She’ll be using her own towels, Helen.”\nThe wom an eyed Claire, who was shamelessly opening the door all the\nway.\n“Starting when?” said Helen.\n“Starting now . You can wash them the same as the others.”\n“Not if they’re not white I can’ t. We bleach them.”\n“They’re white. ” She handed Helen the canvas tote. “There are three\nsets so there’ s no reason she shouldn’ t always have clean towels.”\nHelen took the bag and looked huffily down at the new carpet, the\nwallpaper , the vintage coverlet.\n“I can’ t be held responsible for any damage to the coverlet.”\n“No, of course. Y ou’re not to clean that.”\nI blushed. She was treating Helen so poorly . But maybe this was just a\nfuller , more honest expression of my own classism.\n“Helen was my uncle’ s wife,” said Claire. “But she cheated on him, so\nhe divorced her .”\nHelen nodded in agreement and opened her mouth to add something.\n“It was a long time ago,” said Claire quickly .“Not so long ago,” said Helen, sort of brightening and softenin g. “You\ngirls are too young to understand, but you’ll see.”\n“I’m forty-five,” I said.\n“Oh. Then you know all about  it.” She gave me a warning look that\nmeant we wouldn’ t say more in the presence of the young woman. I\ncouldn’ t tell if this was to protect Claire from the horrors to come, or\nbecause there was a real secret we were keeping for ourselves. I was pretty\nsure I didn’ t know all about it.\n—\nOn the third and final day Claire made me stay out of the room all afternoon\nwhile she “QCed” it.\n“Quality control,” she explained.\n“I know ,
