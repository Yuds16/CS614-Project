ng with the baby strapped to my chest
and now I was waving my hands under a faucet trying to activa te the sink’ s
motion sensor . After a moment I realized there was a foot peda l to start the
water . Where had I seen this before? I mused, but the flashback had already
begun—there’ s always a moment of neutral disorientation before it takes
you down. In the hospital was where. And now I was there with Harris,
wearing the white gown, pressing the pedal with my foot to wash my hands,
sanitize them, but hurrying, hurrying, because I couldn’ t wait another
second to see my tiny baby—it  was too horrible that they were all alone,
just lying there in the clear plastic isolette. But even worse than that: the
cold fear of what might have happened since that morning. Had things
taken a turn for the worse while we were at lunch? Were we back in the red
zone? W e never should have left. Hurry!
All this in a second or two. Then I was back in the restroom, sweating
and weeping with Sam safely swaddled to my chest. I met my own eyes in
the mirror .
So. It wasn’ t over. The past could come back, fully formed, at any
moment, unlock ed by a random combination of sounds and movements. It
was all still with me, down to the smell of the antiseptic soap. I looked at
Sam. They seemed unconcerned , gnawing on a small rubber elephant and
watching me blow my nose.
“I felt so much that I cried. I’m done crying, but I still feel sad. It’s okay
to feel sad.”
That would have to do for now . I drove us home.
For the rest of the day I was so exhausted I could barely move, as if all
my energy had been used up in a single second. Eventually I told Harris
about the flashback and this was like pouring a cup of water down the drain,
no comfort whatsoever . Which wasn’ t his fault—imagine every person who
has ever greeted a time traveler  upon their return home. There’ s no way toask the right questions, being so filled with a belief in the present. What did
the horses smell like?  That would be a good question.
“What are you going to do tonight?” Harris asked now .
“I’m having dinner with Mary .” It came out fully formed, no
forethought. And with this lie my heart began to pound. It was almost four
o’clock.
—
I arrived  at Hertz on the dot and Davey behaved as he had on the previous
days. His face betrayed nothing. As we walked I waited for a signal that we
could pick up where we’d left of f last night, but he seemed breezy .
“Feel like getting a smoothie?” he asked brightly . I didn’ t say anything.
“I do,” he said, steering us into a place called Nekter . With a mango
smoothie in hand he began whistling through his teeth as he headed toward
the bathroom. I was uncertain if I should follow . He whistled right past the
bathroom, past the cleaning supplies, and right out the back door. I hurried
after him into the alley—he strode across it, toward a low, pale-yellow
stucco building. It took me a moment, not being from here, to get my
bearings. This building was the Excelsior , the back of it. That window was
my window, a little too high to climb into. But there was a faded pink
canvas deck chair down at the other end of the alley—he was already
walking to get it. I ran around to the other side of the build ing and let
myself into my room. I pulled back the curtain and slid open the window .
Standing on the chair he heave d himself up easily , jumping through with
one hand on the sill. He turned  and shut the window and curtain and then
immediately put his smoothie on the side table and pulled me to him. If this
had been a movie he would have kissed me now; instead he put both his
arms around me and stood very still, like he was righting something that
had been wrong all day . We just stood, breathing deeply , recovering from all
those seconds of not being together .
“I can’ t ever come in the front again,” he said, stepping back a little.
“It was so late last night  . . . I think you’re fine.” I hoped we could go
back to holding each other . He studied my face.“So, what’ s your . . . marriage arrangement?”
“I mean, I’m married,” I said. “That’ s the arrangement.”
“But it seems like that maybe means something different for you, based
on . . .” He gestured vaguely at me; I looked down at my dress.
“Based on what?”
“On this. Me being here. But also, I guess, your work?”
My work was full of unlikely couplings, unauthorized sex, surrealism,
and a shit ton of lesbianism. Apparently he had taken all this quite literally .
I tried to imagin e myself from his point of view , a married mother somehow
living completely off the rails. She was literally toppling over some kind of
railing, legs in the air .
“I’m the same amount of married as you,” I said. “We’re in the same
boat.”
“That’ s sort of a relief. How guilty do you feel?”
Guilty? My head swam for a moment trying to quantify the amount of
guilt I’d felt, second to second, every day of my life. Such that now, in this
moment, I felt only justified. I was owed.
“I guess guilt feels like a waste of our time,” I said. “I’d rather feel
guilty when I’m alone.”
He nodded, seeming to take the hint, and began syncing his phone to the
stereo. Some smooth R&B sounds came out of the speaker . He lay down on
the carpet and patted the place next to him; I lay down on my stomach.
“I wond ered if we could—” And he showed me, turning onto his side
and reaching for me. I scooted backward into him. He folded his arms
around me, we lay like a married couple in a bed and the song went, I’ve
been thinking ’bout you, you know , know , know . When he got too hard we
rolled apart. Our hands found each other; I pulled one of his fingers to my
lips and he pushed it into my mouth. Throughout my life men had been
pushing their big fingers into my mouth and although I went along with it, I
always thought, Are you out of your mind? What should I put in there next?
Your shoe? How about I just lick the pavement?  But this was entirely
different. I wished it was a little dirtier . I wanted to eat his day; everything
he had done that day. He groane d and pulled it out, but I couldn’ t have that—I reached for his thumb with my lips and caught it and held it, sucking
like a baby , until he pulled that one out, too.
“Best few secon ds of my life,” he whispered, but sat up, forcing himself
away from me. “When do you go?”
“In a week.”
It seemed like a long time to me. Think of how much had happened in
just twenty-four hours.
“You should have come sooner ,” he said. “It took you nearly a week to
come to me.”
I lowered my eyes. I couldn’ t have come to him because I had to make
this room  with his wife. I didn’ t say that. The R&B had changed  to hip-hop.
He suddenly jumped to his feet and turned up the volume. Was he about to
start dancing? I casually rose and made my way to the bathroom, shutting
the door behind me. I rubbed lip balm on my lips and cheeks and fixed my
hair. He was definitely dancing out there. Which was a little awkward.
What was I going to do—stand there and watch and then clap when he was
done? Or maybe  just pretend it was normal. Yeah, that was the way to go
with this.
I glided out, smiling casually as I made my way to the minifridge. I
watched him with my peripheral vision while I made some little snacks
with crackers and avocado and olives. He was good, but he wasn’ t
incredible. Sometimes on Venice Boardwalk you saw a dancer who made
your jaw drop and dollar signs spin in your eyes. Every single person felt
they had person ally discovered the dancer and once in a while the dancer
would appear on a late-night talk show . Even out of the corner of my eye I
could see Davey wasn’ t at that level. Which was a good thing. If he had
been truly talent ed I might have  fallen in love with him; I woul d have felt I
had a God-given right to.
He turned the music down and we ate the snacks I had made. For some
reason they were  especially delicious and I had trouble convincing him that
I wasn’ t a good cook. We listed off all the things we liked to eat. He didn’ t
really know anything about health. He checked Instagram for the millionth
time and I chided him.“You’re on it. I follow you,” he said defensively .
“But I hardly ever look at it.”
“So you don’ t have any internet addiction?”
“I read the news a lot.” This made me sound old. “And I do look at this
one message board.”
“There you go—everyone has something!”
I held up both my hands like, Guilty as charged, and hoped he wouldn’ t
ask me what the message board was for .
“What’ s it a message board for?”
“Shoes.”
It was a messag e board for mothers. Mothers who all had one problem
in common. But I didn’ t want him to think of me as a mother with a
problem.
“Shoes?”
“A certain kind of rare high heel.”
He wrapped his hand around my foot in its white anklet and we fell
silent.
—
Despite what the nurse said, I had scoured the internet for Fetal-maternal
Hemorrhage, looking for someone who had been through it. I learned how
to spell all three of those words , not just the easy word, maternal . Unlike
some topics, which went on and on, there was a very finite number of
internet pages that contained all three together as one thing. There were a
few scholarly scientific papers and a tabloid article about a “ghost baby”
who had survived, thanks to Jesus. That baby’ s mom was already pregnant
again, she’d moved on and was doing great. Which wasn’ t what I was
looking for. I needed a mom who had flashbacks that knocked  her off her
feet in broad daylight.
My mistake (always!) is in laboring  when actually the opposite is called
for; it took me two years to think of simply typing “FMH.” And there it
was: babytalk.com/fmhmomschat. My heart was pounding as I slowly
scrolled. The nurse wasn’ t wrong: it was all mothers of stillborn babies.Some of them wanted to know if this would happen again if they tried
again. Most were just posting to say WTF . WTF just happened ? And since
science didn’ t know , there were no answers—just the echo of other mothers
who had also posted WTF on another night, often in another year. There
was no actual dialogue, only solitary women putting their candle on the
same altar. One husband was writing on behalf of his wife who was too
wrecked to even type FMH or WTF . He wanted to fix this, he wanted
answers. He didn’ t understand  that we never expected answ ers or for
anything to get fixed. The most we ever hoped for was fellowship. It
obviously wouldn’ t be appropriate for me to post. My story was so different
that it was actually the opposite—a miracle—and there was no breakout
thread for mothers of stillborn babies who then lived. So each time I was
knocked out by a flashback I returned to the chat room and just scrolled.
Maybe it was creepy to lurk anonymously , but there was nowhere else to go
and it was much, much better than nothing.
—
Davey slipped his finger into my little white sock and then kissed the back
of my hand; I was surprised that was allowed. He shrugged and said, People
used to do that all the time.
“Sure,” I agreed. “And they do still kiss the queen’ s hand.”
“What queen?”
“The queen of England.”
“Do they?”
“I’m pretty sure.”
He kisse d it again, slowly , and I thought: At this rate we’ll be having sex
by the end of the week.
—
That evening I walked back to the store and bought Brazil nuts, a tin of
sardines, a dark chocolate bar, and two avocados. Beauty foods. Also
several boxes of baking soda and a neutral kind of lotion that you can find
at any drugstore, Vanicream. I rubbed every inch of my wet body withbaking soda then rinsed it off and slathered myself with the white cream
and put on cotto n pajamas. By morning the lotion had all absorb ed and after
a couple days of this my skin became smooth and soft like a child’ s. It
didn’ t seem possible that this whole time I could have had skin like this if I
had only tried harder , no, there was something chemical happening,
biological. It reminded me of the pregnancy glow . When I went one way,
my clothes went the other way, a constant, slippery motion that made me
feel undressed all the time.
And now that I knew he was jerking off to me, my fantasies became
more intimate, specific, as if he could feel me touching myself, too. Often I
rode him slowly for a very long time, like an old hunched man on an
exhausted pony with a steady gait, riding and riding until I c-a-m-e. I had a
brand-new need  for deep penetration; I wanted him, or something, up inside
the center of me. I had a black rubber dick at home. I knew exactly where it
was—the vitamin drawer—and considered sneaking home to get it, but
when I googled  sex shops it turned out they were everywher e, like low-
profile drugstores. The dick I bought in Monrovia was a dumb glittery
purple. When I fucked myself with it waves of sensation radiated upward,
warming my chest all the way to my chin. The feeling was so acute that I
suspected I had a polyp on my cervix that was getting bumped in just the
right way . Or else it was Davey; he’d made me bloom in there.
I didn’t tell him these things because he was always trying to maintain a
boundary , an invisible line like the one between Monrovia and Arcadia.
(“You must have known on that day,” he said, “from the way I looked at
your tits in that little pink sweater .” And I shook my head no, I had no idea,
but I didn’ t explain why because I didn’ t want him to see me from a new
angle, suddenly aging before his eyes like in a horror movie where the
beautiful girl’s face crinkles into that of a wrinkled hag, then a skeleton, and
finally a pile of dust.) He could tell me that he’d jerked off, but he wouldn’ t
say specifically what he fantasized about. He could spend four hours a day
with me, from four to eight p.m., but when he had to leave he couldn’ t be
even a minute late.
“Where does she think you are?”“Dance practice with my friend Dev .”
“Does Dev know about us?”
“No, god no. He wouldn’ t get it. He’d say, ‘Don’ t be a loser , D. Keep it
in your pants.’ ”
“You are keeping it in your pants! Y ou’re doing a great job of that.”
But our moral codes were entirely different. He keeled over, like he was
having an ulcer right then and there. And he actually might have been. He
had never done anything like this, never even been tempted.
“It’s only because it’ s you. Anyone else I’d be able to resist.”
This was meant as a great comp liment, but it felt impersonal to me, like
he’d been caught in the snare of my work. Whereas my feelings for him
were totally pure, I’d simply been drawn to him.
“To my pretty face,” he said glumly . We each worried that the other one
adored something that wasn’ t really us. He wondered if I had told anyone
and I said I had. He had told someone, too. This was both incredible (it
could be told, it was real) and worrisome.
“Does the person you told . . . know who I am?”
“No.”
Being only a little famous was a constant lesson in humility . I often
chastised myself, saying, Look who’s getting too big for their britches . But
no matte r how small I made myself I was always too big for them. They
must have been very small britches to begin with.
“Maybe we could keep it to just one person each,” I suggested. “I don’t
need to tell anyone else, do you?”
“No. This person can be my one person.”
“What did your one person say?”
“Well”—he smiled shyly—“my one person knows me really  well so
they were really happy for me.”
“I like your one person.”
“What did your person say?”
Jordi had been beside herself. She said I sounded completely different,
utterly changed.
“I do?”“Yes, the quality of your voice, it’ s all opened up.”
“Open, open, open,” I said, trying to hear the new quality of my voice.
“Test, test.” I asked if she judged me and she said, How could I judge you?
For what? It’ s brave to feel so much.
“Brave? Why?”
“I guess because it could . . . end in pain.”
I couldn’ t imagine what she meant. Now that I knew it was mutual, no
pain was possible.
—
On Sunday he couldn’ t stay quite as long.
“We kind of have a ritual where we watch—”
My hand shot up in self-defense and he stopped short.
“Sorry ,” he said. “I’m just trying not to rock the boat, you know?”
I had Sunday night rituals, too. Hair washing, cutting tiny nails,  bedtime
story; if I could keep all this at bay then he could spare me the name of their
TV show .
Then, as if this would comfort me:
“I made a dance for you.”
Oh no. He hadn’ t danced again  since the first attempt and I thought he
understood it wasn’ t the best use of our time.
“You did?” I said.
“You look concerned.”
“No, no! I’m not!” I pulled up a chair . “Should I sit?”
He laughed and made sure the curtains were fully shut. He took off his
plaid shirt. He found a song on his phone and I sat and then realized he was
just warming up so I stood and then he changed the song and I could tell it
was about to start and had the sudden feeling of wanting to run out of the
room, like I’d been strapped into a ride at an amusement park that was more
than I could handle. He began moving slowly—slower than slowly , he was
doing some trick that made it look like a fast movement played in slow
motion. I smiled and then frown ed. I felt unsteady , like I was becoming ill
or there was something wrong with the air. What bad timing for somethingto have gone wrong with the heating and cooling system in the room. No—
false alarm—it was just me, holding my breath and tensing up. I was
clenched like a fist, braced against what he was doing. Now he was
speeding up. Going faster and faster . I didn’ t want him to embar rass himself
in front of me. But he wasn’ t embarrassed—he was airborne. He was in a
reverie, moving around the room  with an impossible buoyancy that made it
seem as if he were slowly flying. He touched the floor only once  in a while,
and each tap of his foot propelled him as if he were lighter than air. It dimly
occurred to me that this was the first time I’d seen him dance— last time I’d
been too busy protecting him from humiliation; or maybe I’d seen and been
afraid. Because in a million years no one would ever call this guy second-
rate. Dance was his calling. I was the amateur whose dancing was an
embarrassment. The instinct to video him was strong, to somehow have or
keep what was happening, but of course that was a pedestrian thought. We
were outside the internet, it had never been invented, there was only now. I
just had to take it. Stand there, with one hand on the chair , and endure the
beauty of what was happening.  The very second I succumbed  to it, tears
rose to my eyes in sharp points . Because I could suddenly see that it was
about us, he had figured out a way to show the feeling between us. When he
leapt and turned in the air like that it was ecstatic and obsessive— he did the
move again and again like some kind of endurance art and it only became
more exactly the truth the longer he did it. He was pouring sweat. I was
entirely known and I thought: This is the happ iest moment of my life. And
with that sentence came treme ndous sorrow because nothing was more
fleeting than a dance—dance says: joy is only now. So I gave up on
everything but now. Every opinion and judgment I had ever had, my entire
past including my child and husband and parents, my future, my career , my
eventual death—I let all of it go. Or I did nothing, for once. I just watched
the dance. Still moving, he caught my eye and nodded ever so slightly , as if
I had just arrived.
—He was panting hard and glossy when he finished and his eyes were
unfocused, like he couldn’ t really see. I opened my mouth, getting ready to
praise, but he held up a finger and kind of limped to the bathroom. I heard
the shower go on. I sat on the bed like a person in a foreign waiting room.
“Where are you?” he called out.
I shyly peeked into the steamy little room. He was obscured behind the
rippled glass, just a shape soaping itself. He was ready for my response
now.
“I don’t even know what to say.” I hated when people said that to me—
Well, you better come up with something,  I always thought.
“It was the most incredible thing I’ve ever seen. I don’t even know if I
would call it good.”
He paused in his lathering. “Y ou don’ t?”
“No, of course it was good, it was incredible. But I felt like it was
beyond good and bad. Like a new thing altogether that needs new words.”
This was getting too complicated. “I loved it. Watching you dance was the
happiest I’ve ever been in my life.”
Now he laughed , boyish glee. “I had a fantasy that you would talk to me
while I was in the shower afterward. I mean, I pictured this.”
“I feel like we live together and I do this all the time.”
“Yeah.” He squirted out more bath gel. “This stuf f smells amazing.”
It did.
A very specific tonka bean that Claire would immediately recognize.
I wonde red how I would warn him without saying her name. But I didn’ t
have to.
“Do you have another kind of soap?” he said with sudden urgency . “Or
some shampoo or something?” The mood had changed. He was rummaging
around in my shampoo bottles, smelling each one. “None of these are gonna
cover , they’re not strong enough.”
I looked around the bathroom  in a panic. Toothpaste, rosacea gel,
Vanicream, mouthwash. Mouthwash.
He made an oof noise when I handed him the big bottle of Tom’s
Wicked Fresh mint rinse aid and then began pouring it all over his body .The minty cloud s were so overp owering that we both began coughing. He
said, “I’m coming out,” which I understood meant I shoul d leave the
bathroom. I sat back on the bed and after a minute he emer ged, hair slicked
back, his pants and hoodie back on, but not his sweaty shirt, which he laid
over the back of one of the great chairs. He came over and stood between
my knee s and kind of wrapped his arms around my head and I felt like I
was inside of him, a minty world. My mind didn’ t wander . That was the
thing with him—I never wanted to be anywhere else or think about
anything else. I was entirely present, if that mattered anymore. He
whispered into my hair that he had to go. I said okay because I didn’ t want
to be a grasping, clawing sort of person.
—
I told Jordi everything that had happened and she said she had suspected
that he was a good dancer .
“You did? Even when I said he wasn’ t?”
She said I could  be a tough crowd and she guessed a white boy would
have to be pretty good to even show his face in that world. Sometimes when
she spok e about him I felt jealous of the two of them—Jordi and Davey—
even though they had never met. When she sympathized with his guilt I felt
like a wild animal among humans, missing the qualities that make a thing
civil.
Just as I thought we were finishing up, meaning I had worn her down
with my single, relentless topic, she asked if I was in love with him. I
laughed out loud.
“No, no,” I said, “it isn’t like that. He’s fundamentally kind of goofy . Oh
—he left his shirt here.” I pressed it against my face and breathed deeply .
“I guess from what you said—”
I couldn’t even let her finish. “If you met him you would actually laugh.
I mean, almost anyone you picked off the street would make as much sense
for me to fall in love with as him. In fact, he is literally a person I met on
the street, at a gas station .” I stopped, letting the words gas station  sink in.
“I see. Okay .”There was a distance now between us. Was she angry? She said she was
just tired. She was making a new sculpture, something in green marble.
—
The next day Davey could hang  out only for about an hour; he had to help
Claire with something. I was aghast but smiled and nodd ed passive-
aggressively .
“Don’ t be like that. It’ s just as bad for me.”
Was it? I would have loved to have seen a graph of the relative
badnesses.
We huddled around the hour like a flame and then he left. It wasn’ t good
to have extra time alone. Until four o’clock was the exact right amount of
hours to eat and masturbate and watch a rom-com or two—I didn’t need the
whole evening as well. I ordered a giant spoon for Sam from a company
called greatbigs tuff.com. At five thirty I put on my sneakers and loitered
around the arboretum, alternatin g between thoughts of Davey and picturing
giving this giant spoon to Sam, their delight. They would be with their
after-school sitter now, Leila. If I called her she was unlikely to ask me
anything at all before putting Sam on. Leila was a “do no harm ” nanny—
she didn’ t exactly cultivate or inspire Sam, but they were safe with her. Our
first nanny, Jess, had meditated with the baby , cooked macrobiotic meals,
and given Harris and me shiatsu treatments. She was too good for us and we
knew it. After a year she was poached by a family who could offer her a
401(k), healthcare, and full-time  pay for part-time work. Who had that kind
of money? Jess couldn’ t say, she’d signed an NDA, but we thought it was
probably someo ne high up in local politics since her mom worked in the
mayor ’s office. Whoever it was didn’ t last very long because Jess opened
her own restaurant in Sonoma only a couple years later. Sometimes we still
called out Jess!  as a joke, when  everything was falling apart or we were too
hungry to cook. Sam also yelled Jess! , which was funny because they had
no memory of her. Meanwhile Leila had forgotten that I was out of town
and not in my garage studio.
“You thought I was in the garage this whole time?”“I don’ t usually see you—I go when Harris comes home.”
I went through great measures to not have to go into the house after
school. I even had a pee jar in the garage.
“Right. Well, I’m not back there.” I didn’ t say where I was; this new
generation had a kind of deadpan psychic quality . “Can you put Sam on?”
She gave them the phone and they asked immediately about the big
thing. I was glad to be able to give in.
“It’s a spoon.”
“How big is it?”
“About the size of my leg.”
“That’ s not very big.”
“How big did you think it would be?”
“Like . . . to the ceiling.”
“But how would I get it in the car?”
“You could tie it on top like camping stuf f.”
We talked about how great this would look, like something  from a
Richard Scarry book, and then they asked if I felt like we woul d be getting
a dog when I got home.
I’d forgotten about that, about becoming the kind of easygoing person
who likes to pet dogs. Instead of becoming a Driver (or driving across the
country), I’d doubled down on my Parking. Literally .
“We’ll have to see when I get home,” I said. “It’s hard to make that
decision from where I am.”
“Can I see New York City?” they said, suddenly calling me on
FaceT ime. I answered, keeping my face squarely in the frame as I scanned
the area. Nothin g very New Yorky around here. I headed toward a tallish
parking garage across the street.
“I’m in an outer borough right now .”
“What’ s that?”
“It mean s it’s quieter , no taxis and things.” I huffed and puffed up the
stairs to the top of the parking garage. From there was a rather striking view
of downtown Los Angeles. I flipped my camera.
“Manhattan.”“Wow,” they breathed, taking in the skyline. “I can see the Emp ire State
Building!”
“Yep.”
Not only the wrong city but the wrong time of day. It would be
interesting to see, karmically , how this would come back to me. What lies
Sam would tell me down the road to protect their morally questionable
secret passions.  In case karm a worked this way, I shut my eyes and
mentally tagged my untruth with a little note: Please be safe, sweetie . That
was to Sam, in the future, when they lied to me.
They asked how many more days until I got home and because I had just
negotiated a few extra days, I knew the number well: five. Which seemed
like a long time to both of us, too long, but the moment I got off the phone
it seemed much too short. As I neared the motel Davey texted: Sorry, I thought
she only wanted help getting it in the car. I looked up and saw Claire waiting by
the door . And a mattress. And Davey .
She was so tiny next to him, one of those tall man/little woman couples.
When I sat on his lap I had to kind of hunch over to bring my face down to
his height. She must tilt her face up to his like a child. I waved and she
waved and he nodded carefully . Do no harm,  I said to myself. Do no harm .
I unlocked the door and said thanks for waiting. Claire started to introduce
Davey and then stopped.
“I guess you’ve already met,” she laughed.
I thought she was going to help him, but she just pointed and he dragged
it inside. She seemed to be the boss of the relationship, but it was probably
more complex than that. He had probably saved her from something and
she had saved him, too. I took off the covers and pushed while Davey
pulled their mattress off. Then the two of us put the new one, our mattress,
in its place. Claire helped me remake the bed—we stood on either side,
smoothing and tucking. Anythin g can be a ritual, you just have to name it
before it ends. This was a Ritual of Permission. I permit thee to fucketh my
husband. We finished with the many and flowered pillows, one after
another .TCHAPTER 9
he next day he was busy when I arrived so I had to sit beside a
customer in the row of connec ted chairs while he rented a car to a
woman my age. I tried to figure  out from her back if she was flirting with
him. It made me crazy , other people around him; he gave hims elf so freely
to these customers. In some alternate dimension I engaged with other
people, too. And I had stature!  Sometimes people wanted my autograph!
But I couldn’ t even hold that idea in my mind for one second before it was
overwhelmed by a new and much more profound thought: Who cares. None
of that had any impact on what was going on in this Hertz on the
Arcadia/Monrovia border . I looked at the ceiling, took smooth breaths, and
pulled my shoulders back. The gray-haired woman sitting next to me
chuckled a little and said something under her breath that weirdly sounded
like “Y ou’re admiring him” but obviously wasn’ t that.
“Excuse me?”
“You’re admirin g his . . . physique,” she said, adjusting her turquoise
necklace.
My right ear generated a high-pitched tone and I pressed on it while
smiling and blinking.
“Who?”
“Davey .”
I wasn’t sure if I could perform a believable denial and also, why should
I have to? What  a preposterous thing to say. One didn’ t have to respond to
lunatics. I kept smiling and nodding politely like I couldn’ t understand a
word she said, total gibberish.
“I won’ t tell anyone,” she said with a wink.I laughe d and for a split second I wondered if I could kill her, just
quietly press on part of her neck until she slumped to the ground and then
push her under the bench with the back of my heels. Davey looked up and I
smiled hi. He looked alarmed, rattled by the gray-haired woman , and turned
sharply back to his customer , using a pen to explain a map.
I leaned  away from her. Who was she? A witch? Had she given him
something and now she was owed his soul or firstborn child? She had some
kind of terrible power over him. She extended her clawlike hand in my
direction.
“I’m Irene. His mother .”
Or, she was his mother .
“I’ve seen that look before,” she said. “It always surprises me because
he was late to puberty , still looked like a little boy until he was sixteen or
seventeen. And then all of a sudden: women in the grocery store, girls on
the street, grandmothers .”
My face. I wasn’ t being careful with my face. Jesus Christ. Who else
knew? Everyone who looked at me? He was dying—sweating and
disassembling before his customer . He knew exactly the kind of
embarrassing mom things she was saying. I stood up, turned my back on
her, and walked out of the franc hise. It was an act of solidarity . She doesn’ t
matter , it said. She’s nothing. He immediately texted prayer hands and said
he’d be done in a second.
When I looked up she was beside me again.
“I heard about your four o’clock dates,” she twinkled. From who? Oh.
His uncle who owned the Hertz, that was probably her brother . “Shall we go
have a bite to eat and chat?” she said, taking my arm. I turned and looked at
him helplessly through the window . How could I refuse his mother? Wide-
eyed, he watched us walk away .
We went to Sesame Grill and both ordered the minestrone soup. “It’s the
only thing I can digest here,” she said. “You know he and Claire will be
having children soon.”
“I know that’ s the plan.”
“It’s more than a plan, he’ s totally bound in. He’d be lost without her .”I was of fended by this characterization of him.
“He doesn’ t know the first thing about taking care of himself. He
wouldn’ t know what brand of toothpaste to buy. How old are you? Forty-
five?”
“Yes.” It was disappointing that she had nailed it.
“And you have  a husband and a child and you’re successful  in your
field. Fields.”
She, or Glenn-A llen, or the uncle, had read up on me. “You read up on
me.”
“No, Davey told me.”
I put my spoon down.
“Davey  told you.”
“I know everything. I’m the one person he’ s told.”
At first I didn’ t believe her. Because this would be a good way to get a
person to spill the beans if you had a suspicion.
“I will say this: he’s deeply aroused by you.” She paused to take a long
slurp of soup. “In terms of eros, this surpasses any experience he’s had so
far. I’ve seen it myself, when he talks about you.”
She was bursting. Dying to dump out her whole barrel of crackerjacks
and rusty springs. I kept my eyes on the table in a posture of unwilling
submission.
“Luckily he knows kundalini so he doesn’ t have to waste that energy in
release—he can transform it and use it. For his dance. Do you know
kundalini?”
I didn’ t feel like this was a real question so I didn’ t answer .
“Don’ t worry— I didn’t teach it to him.” She chuckled at this
preposterous idea. “I could have, though! I’ve been studying it for thirty-
five years! But I got him a great teacher—a disciple of my teacher , Suraj. Is
your child a girl?”
Don’ t gender my child.
“Well, when you have a boy there’ s this heavy responsibility to make a
good man. A man who knows what to do with his sexual energy. The day I
saw stains on the sheets I called up my best friend, Audra—you  guys wouldget along, she’s super artistic. I said, ‘Audra, Davey’ s having wet dreams.
It’s time.’ We had talked about this for years, we had an agreement and she
made good on it. The very next day she invited Davey over and they talked
and she became his lover . She had him explore her body , she explained all
the parts of her vagina and vulva. V aginas are complicated , right?!”
My stom ach was in knots and I was kind of hunched over, my forehead
almost touching the table.
“They watched pornography together and he learned how unrealistic it
is. And he had so much sex that it became ordinary for him. He wasn’ t like
other teenage boys, running around causing mayhem because of their
clogged-up fourth chakras. He came into his beauty during this time. He got
serious about dancing, he began dating Claire. That lucky little girl, to this
day she doesn’ t know what hit her. You know she just lies on her back and
lets him do everything? I don’t believe she’s ever fellated him. She’s not
cold—I mean, I love that girl to death, so gifted—but I always told him that
she wasn’t the end of the story . There were other sexual horiz ons. You’ve
been great becau se he’s gotten to use his kundalini. Obviously there can be
no sex, not with you being somewhat of a public figure and married, but I
think you know that and are maybe just having a little crisis because of your
age and all. I’ve been there.”
This was the last straw . I looked her dead in the eyes and shook my
head: No. No more. As I stood  she began fussing with my soup, trying to
summon the waiter .
“She wants this to go! Can she get this to go?” She was pouring the
bowl into a plastic container when I left. I stood on the sidewalk for a
moment and looked back at her through the glass. She held up the container
of soup. I thoug ht about shrieking at the exact pitch that would shatter the
window , it coming down like rain. I walked back to the Excelsior and got in
bed. He had texted, many times.
“What did she say?” was how he answered the phone. My heart
dropped; this was exactly how you would answer the phone if your mom
was inappropriately involved in your sex life.
“She’ s your one person? The one person you told?”He was quiet.
“You know who my one person is? My friend Jordi. She’s a friend . Who
she isn’ t is my mom. Or my dad. Or my mom’ s best friend Audra.”
“She told you about Audra?”
“Oh no. That’ s true?”
“Don’ t make me feel like a freak,” he whispered.
I hadn’ t thought of it that way. He was just a kid when it started. If he
had been  a girl with an overly involved father I’d consider him a victim of
abuse. This was no dif ferent.
“Sorry .”
“Everyone has their shit, right?”
“But why would you tell her? Shouldn’ t you be making a boundary?”
“Who am I gonna tell? A guy friend? She takes this stuff really
seriously , she’s respectful, you know? I can really explain how, like,
profound our thing is and she gets it.”
After a moment he added that he was working on changi ng their
relationship.
“I have to get out of this place. That’ s the problem.”
I liked it when he said I not we about things that probably involved
Claire. He was starting to do that more often. I wondered if it mattered. His
mom would never be my in-law , that was Claire’ s problem. But how skilled
was he? An overly skilled lover was kind of icky—desire should make you
clumsy . I always imagined us tripping all over ourselves with hunger .
“So, you’re doing some kind of kundalini—”
He laughed. “W ell, no, since I jerk of f after every time I see you.”
This made me feel better , that she didn’ t know everything. I laughed a
little and he quickly said, “So can we drop this? My mom’ s weird, and I tell
her too much, but I’m still just this fool who can’ t stop thinking about you.”
“Okay .”
“Thank you.”
“Just one more thing,” I said.
“Oh no.”
“Is it possible you have a thing for older women because of Audra?”“No, you’re not— She was way, way older . I think of you and me as
almost the same age. Roughly .”
“But she was probably my age when you were— Wait, you don’t
still . . . ?”
“No, no. No. She’s like . . .” He started to say how old she was now, but
the number was apparently too preposterously high to say. “No. Not since
Claire. Claire fucking hates her. And she agrees with you that I’m too close
to my mom.”
I didn’ t want to be the same as Claire so I said, Who am I to judge? And
that I hoped when my child was grown they felt even half as comfortable
telling me things (or exactly half as comfortable, that would be a good
amount).
“It’s funny that we’re talking on the phone,” he said. “We’ve never done
that. Am I coming over?”
“Where are you?”
“In front of the smoothie place.”
I considered saying let’s skip it today , as if I had other things
