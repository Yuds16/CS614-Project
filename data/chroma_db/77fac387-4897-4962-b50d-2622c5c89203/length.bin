us taking off our clothes  and him pushing his cock into my pussy ,\nwhich was so wet right now as I came for the first time, and then he was\nfucking me from behind, and now in my ass (Clair e never lets me), as I\ncame again, and then I was sucking him, and I came again, and then he was\nlicking my pussy as if he’d been dying to and I came again, for the fourth\nand last time, and lay exhausted, in his imaginary arms, both of us sweaty\nand sticky and spent. It was the kind of totally present, animal sex that Jordi\nhad. But wait—no sooner had I stopped than I felt the need to start again,\nrubbing myself and writhing around on the very mattress that he had\nejaculated on many times. It was a bottomless fuck, excrucia ting like anitch that couldn’ t be scratched. I had done this before, become infatuated\nand gone on fantasy benders, but this was specific and apart from anything\nprevious, and there were two reasons for this.\n1. I was so surpri sed. I had been  caught off guard, his body had\nsnuck up on me, and this made me feel as if I was not entirely the\nauthor of my fantasies. They seemed to be happening to me and\nthis gave the internal romance a quality of realness that was very,\nvery poignant because\n2. (and this came like a blow to the head in the middle of the night ) I\nwas too old for him.\nThis was my first experience of being too old. I had not alway s gotten\nexactly what I had wanted—men had been unwilling to leave  their wives\nfor me or to do more than flirt— but even in these humbling cases I hadn’ t\nquestioned my right to feel desire. Now suddenly my lust was uncouth,\ninappropriate. I was powerful and interesting, perhaps funny and unique; I\ntook him seriou sly in a way he wasn’ t used to—but he was not jerking off\nto me. Just a few years earlier , at forty or forty-two, I would have been a\ncontender , but now it was too late. And he was just the first one. From now\non this would be the norm. And not just with men younger than me, but\nwith all men. I would never get what I wanted anymore, man-wise.\nBefore my grandma Esther jumped, she emptied all her pill bottles out\nthe window , right onto Park Avenue. The doorman later described them to\nus as “raining down.” We had to keep returning to this building because\nAunt Ruthie, her daughter , inherited the apartment, so there were many\nopportunities to go over the details with the doorman. Mrs. Migdal tipped\nhim big that day, he recalled. Then, after dumping the pills, she put herself\nin a trash bag, a black plastic garbage bag, so that, you know , it wouldn’ t be\na mess for whoever had to clean it up. I’m not quite sure how she got\nherself out the window while still in the bag, but it reminds me of the way\ngirls know how to take off a shirt or change their clothes inside  a sweater ,\nwithout ever being indiscreet. She managed.Twenty-three years later, Ruthie  jumped out the same window . She hung\nin there longer than her mom but not by much. This happen ed seven or\neight years ago, before it had really occurred to me that I was next in this\nmatriarchal lineage.\nI got up and washed my face, the star tiles cool underfoot. How crazy\nand vain did you have to be to kill yourself when you found out that your\nmain thrill, the thing that really got you going, was gone forever? Maybe\nnot so crazy . If birth was being thrown energetically up into the air, we aged\nas we rose. At the height of our ascent we were middle-aged and then we\nfell for the rest of our lives, the whole second half. Falling might take just\nas long, but it was nothing like rising. The whole time you were rising you\ncould not imagine what came next in your particular , unique journey; you\ncould not see around the corner . Whereas falling ended the same way for\neveryone.\nI paced around the new carpet, remembering when my friend’ s eighty-\nyear-old dad had winked at me while I was dancing. This wasn’ t a funny\nanomaly; this was the order of the day. In the future I might be grateful\nwhen this happened, even if the man was ninety , one hundred, one hundred\ntwenty . A man of any age. Trans men, women, and less gendered people\nwere another story (always), but if my hetero tale mattered (and suddenly it\nseemed like it did) then this was a very abrupt conclusion. I had not seen\nthis coming and so I had not lived my life accordingly . I had not gone out\nand done all the straight things I wanted to do while I still could. I had sat\non my nest like a complacent hen, certain that when I felt like strutting\nabout again everything would be exactly as it was before.\nBut to be clear , I had not, at any age, desired a specific male body in the\nway I did now. While all my boyfriends and crushes had been reasonably\ngood-looking, my attraction hovered up near their face, where they kept\ntheir talent and power . Lusting for the whole length of a person, head to toe,\nwas what body-rooted fuckers did, Jordi, and men. Now , for the first time, I\nunderstood what all the fuss was about. How something beautiful could\nstrike your heart, move you, bring you down on your knees and then,\nsomewhat perve rsely , you wanted to fuck that pure, beautiful thing. Sexwas a way to have it, to not just look at it but to be with it. I suddenly\nunderstood all of classical art. The endless carved nudes, Venus in her shell,\nDavid. And sexy clothes. I had worn them without really understanding\nwhy, thinking of sexy as one of many styles, not realizing it was the only\nstyle. You should always be emer ging from a shell if possible. Without\nknowing it, without really understanding it, I had been a body for other\npeople but I had not gotten to have one myself. I had not partici pated in the\ninfuriating pleas ure of wanting a real and specific body on Earth. I lay in\nthe center of the bed, unblinking.\nWanting a body had a seriousne ss to it. When you said you might never\nrecover , you really meant it. This kind of desire made a wound you just had\nto carry with you for the rest of your life. But this was still better than never\nknowing. Or I hoped it was.\nBecause in truth it was like a bad dream, a nightmare. Life didn’ t just get\nbetter and bette r. You could actually miss out on something and that was\nthat. That was your chance and now it was over. I wondered if I would\ncontinue with my work and then I realized that my work was all I had now.\nI had gotten it completely wrong—I thought I was laboring toward a prize,\nbut the prize was right there, I already had it, and work was something I\ncould do afterwa rd, after I was no longer young enough to be beautiful and\ncould no longer be wanted by someone beautiful.\n—\nHow’s New York now? Harris texted. Better?\nI’d been in New York for five days already . But I still had a full day left\nand then another week to drive back across the country . There was plenty of\ntime for more walks. I looked at the clock and added three—tw o a.m. was\npretty late to still be awake in New Y ork, but not if I was living it up.\nI texted the party emoji, heart eyes, the Statue of Liberty , and asked how\nSam was.\nHe texted a thumbs-
